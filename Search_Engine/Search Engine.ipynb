You canput more if you want,108  -   but this is nicely hot.109  -   Teaspoon of cumin.110  -   And a teaspoon of oregano,111  -   and about a tablespoonfulof brown sugar.112  -   And about a tablespoonfulof salt.113  -   Seems like a lot, but w ve gotat least a kilo and a half114  -   of ribs there.115  -   So tha s the basic rub.Give that a mix.116  -   And what w re gonna do is w regonna use the same basic ingredients117  -   in the actual barbecue sauceor braising liquid.118  -   And the whole idea is that the regonna cook for a period of time119  -   and all that braising liquid is gonna reducedown, get all sticky and then go on the rib.120  -   So basically chuck your ribs in,you can do a few at a time,121  -   and make sure i s just nicelyrubbed into the rib.122  -   Alright?123  -   And like I say, you can marinatethese and then pop them in the fridge.124  -   W re gonna pretend that thesehave been marinating for a couple of hours,125  -   and w re gonna put them ontothe barbecue to give them that charry126  -   smoky flavor. I s gonna give itquite a noticeable flavor,127  -   even though w re gonnabraise it afterwards.128  -   You ca t really,with this kind of meat,129  -   just barbecue it and expect itto be really tasty and morish.130  -   I s gonna be chewy, because ther sa lot of connective tissue on there,131  -   so tha s why it gotta gothrough the braise.132  -   Because what will happenin the fridge133  -   is that all those lovely paprikaand chilli powder and garlic134  -   all just gonna get into the meat.135  -   And i s amazing, how much differencethat marinade makes, actually.136  -   - All over?- Yep.137  -   Okay.138  -   And then w re gonna just putjust a little bit of oil139  -   just to help that outon the barbecue,140  -   and then w re gonna pop overto the barbecue and grill those.141  -   Carrie, thanks very much.Tha s your job done.142  -   And  ll just grill these for a fewminutes on each side.143  -   Nice and high,nice and hot.144  -   Just so we get that nicecharry flavor.145  -   Now you do t have to do this,you can put it on the griddle pan,146  -   or you can just roast it well147  -   in a roasting pan and pour allthe marinade over the top,148  -   but you will notice a difference.149  -   Because you do t have that charrinessof the grill and from the smoke.150  -   So there will be about three to fourminutes on each side,151  -   just to get that charriness.152  -   Okay, next up, w re gonnamake the sauce153  -   that the ribs are gonnabraise in.154  -   So w ve got a couple of extra ingredientson top of essentially the same spices155  -   that are in the rub,so nice and easy.156  -   So  ve got a cup of maltedvinegar.157  -   And this is to give youthe acidity.158  -   Because remember, you want sweetnessand acidity in any good barbecue rib.159  -   And then brown sugar, i s abouta cup of brown sugar.160  -   And then you got abouthalf a cup of bourbon.161  -   And then you got one onion,finely diced.162  -   You got one tomato, finely diced,just leave all the seeds in.163  -   Cause remember, this is all gonacollapse and break down.164  -   Two tablespoons of tomato sauce.165  -   Got about a tablespoonof Dijon mustard.166  -   W ve got a teaspon of cinnamon.167  -   Got a teaspoon of cumin.168  -   Got a teaspoon of chilli powder.169  -   So again, very similar tothe marinade.170  -   Teaspoon of smoked paprika.171  -   And then  ve got a teaspoonof mustard powder.172  -   Tha s English mustard powder.And a couple of bayleaves.173  -   And then I want a goodpinch of salt.174  -   About a teaspoon,teaspoon and a half.175  -   Next up, w re gonna putthe peel, or the zest from the orange.176  -   And this will caramelizeand break down,177  -   so tha s why  m putting it inin long strips,178  -   cause tha s gonna caramelizeas it cooks.179  -   What  m doing is just bringingthat mixture up to the boil,180  -   so when the ribs are cooked,the ve got that nice caramelization,181  -   the re gonna goin the resting tray,182  -   and then that hot marinade goesover the top.183  -   Putting in a jalapeno,seeds and all,184  -   tha s gonna add a bit of kickto the sauce.185  -   Just to infuse all thoseflavors,186  -   and what  m getting isthat sweet-sour187  -   and then a bit of thatchilli heat kicking through,188  -   so le s have a look atthese ribs.189  -   This is what  m after,  m afterthis nice charriness here.190  -   The re not far off.191  -   Right, nice non-stick heavy-dutyroasting pan. Important.192  -   And then in go the ribs.193  -   And the reason i s important,is that194  -   if you got a flimsybaking tray,195  -   it does t conduct the heat that well, youwant something like this, if you buy that,196  -   even though i s gonna be much moreexpensive than a flimsy roasting tray,197  -   i s gonna last you a lifetime,especially at home.198  -   I s important that you get a niceeven distribution of heat199  -   all through that dish.200  -   So, ribs have been grilled and le sput the sauce on.201  -   And then all w ve got to do ispour this lovely sweet and sour sauce202  -   over the top ofthe ribs.203  -   Look at all that. That looksabsolutely...204  -   Jeez, cleans your nose as well.Beautiful.205  -   So all tha s gonna happen is thisjust goes in for a206  -   bit of a slow braise for aboutan hour and a half207  -   until the re nice and soft.208  -   And how do you knowthe re nice and soft?209  -   Basically, you should be able topush the spoon through the flesh,210  -   or through the pork meatbetween the bones.211  -   And if you can push it through,then i s cooked.212  -   Cause it tells you that when youeat it, i s gonna be nice and tender.213  -   Right, now.214  -   These are gonna go into the ovenat about 195 degrees for an hour and a half.215  -   And the whole idea is that youturn those as the liquor starts to reduce216  -   and starts to caramelize,217  -   maybe three or four times duringthat hour and a half.218  -   And hopefully, at the end yo re gonnahave just enough sauce219  -   just to coat those ribs, to makethem nice and shiny, and sticky.220  -   Tha s all you need.221  -   After the break.222  -   Gary plates up hissticky ribs.223  -   Ok, so who wants to taste?224  -   And the all-American feastcontinues225  -   with Georg s classic Waldorf saladand easy mayonnaise.226  -   Wow, that looks great,George.227  -   W ve got the ribsnow in the oven228  -   and they need to cook for aboutan hour and a half229  -   so that the re nice and tender.230  -   In the meantime, George,what are you gonna make?231  -    m gonna make a simpleWaldorf salad,232  -   an inspiration from the Waldorfhotel in New York City.233  -   Wha s the essence of a good Waldorf?234  -   I think fresh apple,fresh celery,235  -   you know, walnuts,toasted walnuts,236  -   but a really deliciousand yummy mayonnaise.237  -   And tha s my job.238  -   Tha s your job cause youmake a great mayonnaise.239  -    ve been waiting to show youhow to make a simple mayonnaise.240  -   Why, because i s so easy. Do thave to buy it,241  -   and a few of you had problems.I s the whole emulsion,242  -   or the whole idea of the emulsionthat yo re having problems with.243  -   And the emulsion in a fresh egg mayonnaiseis the egg and the oil.244  -   And once you understandhow that all comes together,245  -   yo ll have confidence.246  -   Now somebody that did tdo too well was Alvin247  -   with your coleslaw.248  -   It is the first time h s mademayonnaise, you can tell,249  -   and tha s not the best coleslaw, ll be honest.250  -   So with that in mind, Alvin,come up,251  -   and yo re gonna help mewith the mayonnaise.252  -   Okay, Alvin, this is amazinglysimple, yo re gonna laugh.253  -   First of all, nice little blenderlike this, this little canister blender.254  -   I s very fast, instead ofhaving to use a whisk,255  -   which you can, you can cheatand use this baby.256  -   One tablespoon full of mustard,nice and heaped.257  -   Yep, good.258  -   Mustard is an emulsifier. So tha s gonnahelp emulsify the egg and the oil.259  -   Two whole eggs.260  -   Ah. Whole eggs, not justegg yolks.261  -   Lot of recipes require justegg yolks,262  -   tha s classic, but the egg whitehelps it bond and bind as well,263  -   and ther s nothing worse than havingrecipes with egg yolks only,264  -   cause what do you do withegg whites, right?265  -   Two tablespoons full ofsweet vinegar,266  -   in this case a white balsamic.267  -   And I like that little bit of sweetness,because a lot of bought mayonnaises268  -   got added sugar, peopleget used to that flavor,269  -   but i s actually quitenice.270  -   Cause i s the whole acidity and sweetnessthing at play again.271  -   Pinch of salt.272  -   Now because a blenderis so fast,273  -   unlike whisking by handwhich is slow,274  -   you can put a large amount of oilin to start off with275  -   cause the blades spin, bang, hundredsof times within the first few seconds.276  -    m gonna put a good measureof oil first.277  -   Click the lid on,start it off.278  -   And just give it ten seconds.279  -   Ten seconds, on.280  -   Can you see it coming together?281  -   Turn it off.282  -   You can see this is not split,even though i s thin,283  -   see how i s all emulsifiedtogether,284  -   so you can use that as goodindicator to put another285  -   quart of the oil in,turn it on.286  -   See how it smooths out there?Turn it off.287  -   Another third of the oil.288  -   Turn it on.289  -   And give it anotherthirty seconds.290  -   Same thing will happen.291  -   Now, see it?292  -   Tha s it.293  -   And again, you can havea look at it.294  -   See? I s nice and smooth.295  -   Add half of that.296  -   Turn on again.297  -   Looking beautiful.298  -   Okay, done.299  -   Now we want this really thick,alright?300  -   See wha s happening?301  -   I s so thick now that the machin shaving trouble just mixing it around.302  -   So remember that if yourmayonnaise looks particularly oily,303  -   you can add a little splash of wateror vinegar or lemon juice,304  -   just to sort of bring it together,because i s the water,305  -   that will also then act as sort ofa medium to allow it to emulsify.306  -   It becomes too oily,it will split.307  -   Turn it back on.308  -   Okay, done.309  -   Wow.310  -   Does that look a littlebit different to your mayonnaise?311  -   Just do t need eat the whole lot.But just try that.312  -   Tip your finger in it. And obviouslyyou can season that the way you want.313  -   Creamy.314  -   Really good.315  -   I s a great mayonnaise.316  -   I s just very simple. You can addwhatever flavor you want into it,317  -   but remember, use a little canisterblender like that, makes it very very easy.318  -    m not even gonna botherputting it into a container.319  -    m done,  ll see you in a minutewith your Waldorf salad.320  -   - Ciao.- Cheers, mate.321  -   Right, so Waldorf salad.322  -   The essence of the Waldorf saladis the acidity and sweetness of that apple,323  -   and the mayonnaise.324  -   So w re gonna really accentuatethose elements.325  -   The apple, I wanna put a couplelittle textures on there,326  -   so  m gonna make a simpleapple jelly,327  -   and as well as that,fresh apple on the plate.328  -   So to make the apple jelly, Adam,come up, join me,329  -   le s make it together, mate.330  -   I think for me when I make anytype of fruit jelly,331  -   i s all about the fruit.332  -   If i s apple, all I wanna putinto it is apple.333  -   I do t wanna start fussing it around toomuch with adding other elements,334  -   other flavors.335  -   Using the juicer you can leech outall those beautiful flavors.336  -   So the first step is to makeapple juice.337  -    m using green apples because I thinkthe ve got a real lovely tartness to them.338  -   As well as sweetness, ther s thissort of bitterness and sharpness about them,339  -   that I really love.340  -   W re just gonna quickly removethat pith, and the pips.341  -   The pips are bitter, and they are tgonna add beautiful flavor to it.342  -   You ever made a jelly before,Adam?343  -   I have actually,on the weekend.344  -   - What did you make?- Maple syrup jelly.345  -   Yum, delicious.346  -   Okay, next step, squeeze a lemon, so itdoes t oxidize or go brown, the apple.347  -   Next step, juicer.348  -   Pop all your apples in, and thenput the lid on and then turn it on.349  -   Sure.350  -   Joanne, you got a question?351  -   If you do t have a juicer, can youuse like a good organic juice? Apple juice?352  -   Nothing saying you ca t.I just love freshly squeezed juice.353  -   I think ther s just nothing better.- Yeah.354  -   Beautiful. Fantastic.355  -   So we set that aside. Next stepis to soak our gelatin.356  -   For 500 mils of apple juice,w ve got four sheets of gelatin.357  -   We need to soak the gelatin.358  -   Look, I prefer to use gold leaf gelatin,i s a refined product.359  -   I s top notch, i s the A grade stuff.360  -   You can use powdered gelatin,if you prefer.361  -   Adam, thank you, mate.- Thanks, George.362  -   Right guys, our gelatin has beensoaking in water.363  -   And w re just gonna pop thatinto a pan,364  -   and then with a little bit of the juicew re just gonna temper the gelatin.365  -   And I only do that with a little bitof the juice,366  -   I do t do it with all of it. I do twanna boil this, okay?367  -   The flavor is complete for me. If Iboil it,  m gonna affect its flavor.368  -   And generally what you do, when youboil something or cook something369  -   so delicate like that, you sendall that flavor into the air.370  -   I want it in there. I do twanna lose that.371  -    m just gonna parse this liquid now,as you can see i s starting to separate.372  -   So w ve got froth on the top,and all the juice on the bottom.373  -   So as you can see, our gelatinis melting in with that little bit of juice374  -   of the apple that we added in there.375  -   Now  m gonna add thismelted gelatin into my apple mixture,376  -   and just stir that through.377  -   Then this goes into a tray.378  -   This will take about an hourto two hours to set in a fridge.379  -   Because we have t gotmuch time380  -    m going to pop that jelly intothe blast freezer381  -   and chill it down as quicklyas possible.382  -   Right guys, the next step.383  -   Gary made this beautiful mayonnaise,and what  m gonna add to it384  -   is some onion, sweet and sour.385  -   This is ultra, ultra simple,okay?386  -   One onion, finely diced.387  -   You do t need oil.388  -   Sugar. One,389  -   two,390  -   and a half tablespoonsof sugar.391  -   In keeping with the theme of the Waldorfsalad,  m using a cider vinegar,392  -   probably about half a cup.393  -   Gas, a nice sort ofmedium heat.394  -   Now this is what our onionswill look like after 20 minutes.395  -   Ther s no color, the re justnice and translucent,396  -   and sort of goldenish.397  -   As you can see, ther s not muchliquid left at all.398  -   I s all dissolved pretty much.399  -   So  m gonna add a couple of spoonsof this delicious mayonnaise Gary made.400  -   One,401  -   two,402  -   and that forms the dressingto our Waldorf salad.403  -   Onion mayonnaise,sweet and sour.404  -   Right, I want to put some freshgreen apple on there.405  -   And I just wanna do nice,thin slices,406  -   that  m going to presenton the plate.407  -   And just a little bit of lemon juiceover the top,408  -   so it does t oxidize or go brown,the apple.409  -   Right,  m gonna toast some walnutsand I think, again,410  -   the walnuts are a crucial elementto the Waldorf salad.411  -   So we throw a few of thesewalnuts into a pan.412  -   And  m just gonna sugar them lightly413  -   and just sort of dry roastthem in the pan. Okay?414  -   A little pinch of salt,tha s as simple as that.415  -   Right, le s plate up.416  -   So, first of all, our sweet and souronion mayonnaise.417  -   So blob,418  -   blob,419  -   and then some apples.420  -   Few up like that.421  -   Few up like that.422  -   Then some of our little babycos leaves, just gorgeous,423  -   I wanna show these off.424  -   Some celery.425  -   Just gonna stand these up, and again,show them off, cause the re just beautiful.426  -   Then some walnuts.427  -   Next up is these beautifulnasturtium leaves.428  -   You can buy these from anygood nursery, these nasturtium leaves.429  -   Next, some of these frisee,w re just gonna scatter that around.430  -   I s starting to lookreally beautiful.431  -   Great, jelly set.432  -   And  m simply just gonna scoopsome nodules out of jelly433  -   and just pop that on the plate.434  -   Without any fuss, does t needto be cubes or squares.435  -   And then finally, a bit of the old fella,my mate olive oil,436  -   and some of Gar s mate,salt.437  -   Right guys, so her s my interpretationof a Waldorf salad.438  -   Wow, that looks great,George.439  -   Now for the ribs.What a contrast.440  -   Beer ribs and your beautifulsalad.

Prawnsare available in hundreds of species.534  -   You can buy them on the markets green,which is uncooked, or cooked.535  -   Fresh prawns do t really lastbecause a prawn has an enzyme in it536  -   which actually keeps growingwhen the prawn dies.537  -   The head goes black and the headwill start to droop.538  -   So a frozen prawn is better.539  -   Yo re better off taking it home,defrosting it under clean running water.540  -   First, school prawns, you canbuy them green or cooked,541  -   then, lightly floured,pan fried or deep fried542  -   with a bit of aioli, lemon juice,really, tha s all you need.543  -   You can eat it all as well.544  -   The cooked ones are greatfor barbecues,545  -   just give them to your guestswith a finger bowl and a cloth.546  -   The king of all prawns for Australiais the Eastern King.547  -   I s got beautiful flesh, i swonderfully flavored,548  -   and when you cook it, it staysnice and firm.549  -   Take you next into the world of crabs,now crabs,  ll be back in a minute.550  -   This guy nearly got me.551  -   Tha s a Queensland mud crab.552  -   When you feel for a crab,when you pick up a crab,553  -   fingers underneathand hold it like that554  -   and hope to hell that i s tight,because that yo ll lose your finger,555  -   that will take your finger off no problem,or crush it very badly.556  -   You hold them quite tight, and if youroll them over you can feel the weight.557  -   Ther s another train of thoughtwhere if you squeeze this back flipper,558  -   should be nice and firm as well.559  -   Look at this guy.560  -   This is actually just knownas a giant crab.561  -   They grow to another seven to eightkilos with claws the size of my arm.562  -   And the way to eat these is enjoy itin a restaurant with about ten friends.563  -   It costs you a lot less,and what will happen564  -   is that the ll bring it out to youin about ten courses.565  -   So yo ll start with the soup,then fried with noodles, then the claws,566  -   i s just a wonderful way to eat.567  -   Crustaceans is all about familyand friends568  -   and being with a group of people.569  -   All right, next cra sthe beautiful blue swimmer.570  -   Cooked and green or blue. One of theonly crustaceans that do t come live.571  -   They do t survive very wellout of the water.572  -   Good in Thai curries. One of the bestcurries  ve ever had573  -   was the Thai yellow curry sittingon a beach in Thailand with a beer.574  -   You could steam them,take the meat out,575  -   but if yo re gonna do that,buy these cooked, guys.576  -   All right, her s an exciting577  -   development in the worldof Australian aquaculture.578  -   Soft-shell crabs are amazingbecause you can eat the whole shell.579  -   These guys are great to cookin handrolls like the Japanese do.580  -   The Americans crumb them.581  -   I just prefer battered, like a bitof tempura batter. Deep fried.582  -   Again, really crisp and nice,583  -   and the sensation of eating a wholecrab, shell and all but also584  -   beautiful flavors and sweet,lovely flesh.585  -   OK, I have a live southern rocklobster and a live local lobster.586  -   You can tell the re very different.587  -   The local lobster comes from the southcoast of New South Wales, around Ulladulla.588  -   Southern rock lobster is foundall the way around the coastline,589  -   probably from Queensland all the waydown to Western Australia.590  -   Varieties change, the species change, butthe southern rock lobster is the prized one.591  -   I s prized for the flavor of its flesh,i s prized for its size, and also592  -   for the way that the flesh cooks.593  -   I s beautiful and soft and italso makes wonderful sashimi.594  -   On the freshwater side, ther s a fewothers that  d like to show you.595  -   Ther s a marron, which is whatwe are using today.596  -   And this is, as I said, fromWestern Australia,597  -   and really one of the trueindigenous species of Australia.598  -   And a yabby.599  -   The thing about freshwater fish thoughis the re probably a little bit600  -   short on the flavor.601  -   They have a nice sweetness,602  -   but you really need to think when yo recooking with freshwater crayfish603  -   about what yo ll combineto enhance the flavor.604  -   And I think i s up to youwhich way you want to go.605  -   I feel that tha s the king, and i sreally one of the most beautiful creatures.606  -   And the color of the shell, once i scooked, i s stunning.607  -   These guys in salads are beautiful, as longas yo re really careful with how,608  -   what you put it in withand how you cook it.609  -   All right, finally, bugs.610  -   Now, most people do t like to eat bugs,but bugs ar ethese wonderful creatures.611  -   Ther s about five varieties.612  -   The one with the wide, round headis a balmain bug.613  -   The thing about a balmain bugis it has a very,614  -   very distinctive flavor.615  -   Some people dislike it immensely,others love it.616  -   So if you do t like the strength of theflavor, then you go for a Moreton Bay bug.617  -   But as a cooked product,this is great.618  -   Live, chill them down, and thenuse them in salads or stir fries.619  -   I have to tell you one more thing.All of this stuff, the re all animals.620  -   The re all creatures, and a lot of themare best live.621  -   So you need to dispatchwith these creatures humanely.622  -   I s a big part of it, you know.623  -   The most humane way to do itis to chill them.624  -   So that means, put them in the bagthat you get them from,625  -   into the freezer. Do t let them freezebecause it will break down the flesh.626  -   But it needs to get to the stage, wherethey are actually just very slow.627  -   Once the ve come out of the freezer,they are virtually incapacitated628  -   and they wo t be feeling pain.So do it very quickly.629  -   Cut them directly in half.630  -   The other way to do is buy themat the markets and the ll kill it for you.631  -   If you bring a big pot of water to boiland you put a crustacean into it,632  -   it does t matter what size it is,and you cook it for eight to nine minutes,633  -   yo ll find that i s always perfect.634  -   When we return.635  -   Quite easy just to crack them with yourfingers and then break them open.636  -   Peter reveals the simplicityof his showstopping marron salad.637  -   All about sensation, tha swhat food is all about.638  -   This dish is a salad of marron,shaved fennel,639  -   avruga and Asian dressing.640  -   I s really simple, i s light,and i s all about flavors.641  -   First off, starting with the sauce,ther s a few classic techniques.642  -   Firstly, julienne.643  -   You just slice the chilliall the way down the middle644  -   and then you need to flatten it up,take the seeds out first,645  -   but then to get really, reallynice julienne,646  -   you actually need to takea lot of the flesh away,647  -   because what you wanna do is justhave the skin.648  -   So by placing a knife downlike that,649  -   having your fingers nice and flatin case you slip,650  -   and just shaving a perfectlittle piece off the chilli.651  -   And then let your knifejust slide over.652  -   So, tha s a julienne, going toput that into here.653  -   Next will be a chiffonade.I s like a julienne but654  -   you usually use itfor leaves.655  -   You want a really fine garnish if yo remaking a soup or something like that,656  -   and you want to put some leavesthrough it,657  -   to chiffonade them isa great way to do it.658  -   So take all the stems off,659  -   and w re doing it with justone stalk of coriander.660  -    m also going to use for flavorthe root of the coriander.661  -   So  m just gonna take onecoriander root.662  -   We want to extract all the flavor,just bang it and then chop it.663  -   People throw the very endof the root away but664  -   if you know Thai cuisine,tha s where the flavor is.665  -   That goes into the plate.666  -   Now, chiffonade. You can putall the leaves together.667  -   Very fine again, i s all about colorand you notice too that668  -    ve got no liquids in therebecause this is a very fresh dressing.669  -   If I put all the liquids in, which arequite strong flavors,670  -   wha s gonna happen is thateverything will wilt,671  -   the colors will go and i s notgonna be as nice to eat.672  -   So next is brunois.Tha s a fine dice, so673  -   to get the finest dice, slice downas close as you possibly can.674  -   Halfway, and then one more time,so yo re doing three cuts into the onion.675  -   And then, just again, a nice dicestraight through.676  -   And  ll throw that in as well.677  -   Next is garlic, crushed garlic.678  -   You crush garlic like this, yo re reallygetting all the essence out of it.679  -   Just remember that yo vedone it on this board680  -   before you have your vegemiteand toast in the morning,681  -   tha s not the best.682  -   All right, so next is spring onion.683  -    m not using the leaves, ve got my green in there684  -   and I do t really need it, what  mafter is the real flavor from this.685  -   And then, doing a rough julienne.686  -   Turning it around, and finelydicing it.687  -   Textur s really important in food,i s how it feels in your mouth,688  -   i s like wine or anything,i s all that sensation,689  -   tha s what foo s all about.690  -   Next we have to have twobeautiful limes.691  -   Just give it a nice roll, okay?692  -   Yo re gonna loosen up all the littlecells in there693  -   and yo ll get more juice out of it,so you get value for money.694  -   Using a microplane, I just wannaget the zest695  -   by using as much of two limesas you can.696  -   Okay, so just juicing them. Juice andzests make two different flavors.697  -   The zest has that really oily, beautifulcitric sort of flavor,698  -   but it does t have the acid, and thenyou add the juice too699  -   and it sort of brings it up and gives youthat beautiful citric acid as well.700  -   A fifty grams of brown sugar,adds a sweetness,701  -   stir this through, i s really importantthat it dissolves,702  -   that you do t have any solidbits of sugar in there.703  -   Brown sugar has more molasses in it,so you get that beautiful caramely flavor.704  -   So the lime and brown sugar,about 30 mils of fish sauce,705  -    m saying about because the concentrationof salt in fish sauce changes.706  -   So you start with that and thenadd more,707  -   i s very hard to take out salt,one of those ones708  -   tha s very very very hardto remove.709  -   Put less than you think,add at the end,710  -   and that way yo re gonna end upwith a much better result.711  -   Five mils of soy sauce, measure this,try and use light soy sauce712  -   cause we do t wanna be addingtoo much salt.713  -   Just make sure all the sugaris dissolved,714  -   add it to your ingredients715  -   and stir.716  -   Now i s time to taste,now i s time to balance.717  -   Try not to double dip when youtaste as well.718  -   Perfect.719  -    m lucky this time.720  -   But try to get it right the first coupleof times, because with strong sauces,721  -   once yo ve tasted it a few times,you ca t taste anything.722  -   But now tha s fresh, i s crunchy,ready to go, so  m gonna put it to side,723  -   the next stage is garnish.724  -   So, grapes.725  -    m using flame grapes,because they have no seeds.726  -   Ther s another little garnishI have, which is just chives.727  -   And then all w re doing is justcutting some batons.728  -   This is a pretty part of it.729  -   Shave fennel, a mandolin or a verysharp knife.730  -   Three more ingredients.731  -   First one, and I have to use it,flying fish roe.732  -   We are at Flying Fish. But the reasonI love to use this,733  -   Japanese use it and most peopleuse it for the same reason,734  -   and that is a crunch, a greattexture and a beautiful flavor as well.735  -    m also gonna use avruga.736  -   Now avruga has an amazinglysmoky flavor.737  -   But i s actually not caviar.It looks like it, but i s fish,738  -   which has been ground up and thenmade to look like fish eggs,739  -   and flavored with a littlebit of smoke.740  -   And lastly, sumac. Anyone knowwhat sumac is?741  -   Kind of some... Middle-Easterncultures use it a lot.742  -   Yeah, it gives anothersensation.743  -   The last thing we have to do now,is clean the cooked marrons.744  -   Very simple. Push the shell in,and twist it.745  -   And then you get all of it.746  -   Let me do one of the claws, so youbreak them off at the first knuckle.747  -   Next, removing the shell. I s quiteeasy, just crack them with your fingers,748  -   and then break them open.749  -   And what yo re trying to dois to get the piece of meat out750  -   intact, looking lovely.Okay?751  -   Next stage, using the heel of your knife,just crack it lightly,752  -   and peel that off, so that you havea whole claw intact,753  -   and that really is just a garnish.754  -   Next, just cutting it downthe middle,755  -   and here yo ll see theintestinal tract.756  -   Just take it out, and squarethem off757  -   so that i s gonna looklovely.758  -   For each one of these dishesI am just using five pieces.759  -   Now, to plate it.760  -   The fennel with the sauce,two spoonfuls of that into it.761  -   W ll get a nice mix.762  -   One bowl is enough for four serves.763  -   Little bit of fennel in the bottom.764  -   And now  m just gonna buildit with marron.765  -   The next, the sauce.766  -   Just another little spoonfulon top.767  -   Next is the avruga, one nice spoonfulwill allow the smokiness of this come out.768  -   Just on top.769  -   Followed by three pieces of grape.Just for visual effect.770  -   Next, sumac.771  -   And next, flying fish roe. A greatsensation as far as textur s concerned.772  -   Nice flavors as well. The next isthe claws, just surround the outside.773  -   Something else for people to bite.774  -   And then a garnish of chive.775  -   So tha s it guys, salad of marron,shaved fennel, and avruga. Asian dressing.776  -   Come up and taste.777  -   So visually, lots of colors,there should be lots of flavors there too,778  -   and I suggest you get a little bit ofeverything on your spork an have a try,779  -   so please.780  -    m someone that does t likereally strong flavored seafood,781  -   but I love the marron, becauseit is quite subtle,782  -   and then it really complementsputting the grapes with it783  -   is a really lovely complement, becausei s a little bit sweet too.784  -   Oh, thank you.785  -   So ther s three tips that I thinkyou should always use786  -   when you make a dish like this.787  -   Firstly, fresh seafood. Make friendswith your fishmonger.788  -   The most vital thing, you ca t takesalt out. So just make sure789  -   that you add a little bit lessand then finish it off by tasting it.790  -   And the last of course, keep it simple.Look after your flavors,791  -   and people always enjoy your food.792  -   Up next,Gary goes Italian793  -   with a flavor packed renditionof veal saltimbocca.794  -   What you wanna do is cook that vealso i s still pink in the middle.795  -   And a little later.796  -   Tha s looking beautiful, look howshiny tha s looking.797  -   George presents an elegant dessert treat.White mousse canelloni.798  -   I love it.  m goingto make that.799  -   Next up in MasterClass, w re goingto do an Italian classic using veal,800  -   which is veal saltimbocca.801  -   What veal saltimbocca isis veal802  -   wrapped in pancetta orprosciutto with sage.803  -   So I need a helper for this one.804  -   Callum, can you come upand give me a hand?805  -   Sure.806  -   This is a pretty expensivepiece of veal.807  -   First up w re just gonna take offthe scotch essentially from the rib.808  -   What I wanna do is cut littlesteaks from this, little scallops,809  -   that are about 120 gramsor so,810  -   which w re gonna batout lightly.811  -   All right, Callum? If you can stretch outa bit of that clean film,812  -   and then just pop those rightin the middle and equidistant apart813  -   and then put another layerover the top,814  -   and  ll show youthe first one.815  -   When you bat something out,yo re not whacking it randomly,816  -   just trying very lightly,work in nice neat lines,817  -   I need to work across and then up,or up and then across,818  -   but work in a methodical fashion.Be very gentle.819  -   Hold the hammer close to the headof the hammer,820  -   so that yo re not putting inenormous amount of weight on,821  -   and then yo ve got some control.822  -   Just very gentle, yeah?823  -   Yeah, perfect.Brilliant.824  -   Le s do the next phase, and tha s wrappingthese little babies up with the sage.825  -   Yo re just gonna put theseslices down.826  -   This is the pancetta.827  -   And then what w re gonna do is puttwo nice leaves of sage on each of the veal.828  -   Face up like that.829  -   Just press them downonto the meat.830  -   And what that sage is going to dois put flavor into that veal.831  -   And then kind of what you want to dois just put these832  -   upside down and then wrap themquite tightly and so that the ve stuck833  -   and you get that little piece ofveal like that. Alright?834  -   The term saltimbocca meansleap in your mouth or jump in your mouth835  -   which is really interesting because we sayveal saltimbocca and it sounds beautiful836  -   whereas if we put veal jump inyour mouth on the menu,837  -   noone would buy it. Alright.Thanks for that.838  -   You can go and havea little seat.839  -   Next stage in the saltimbocca,you do t have to do this,840  -   but i s a little dusting of flour.So  m gonna put some pepper and salt.841  -   onto the flour just to season it,and then what I wanna do842  -   is just very lightly dip that in,843  -   and all this will do is it will giveyou a lovely golden brown finish844  -   on the saltimbocca. And also, m gonna deglaze the pan845  -   and make a little sauce in it, and it willleave a little flour residue in the pan,846  -   which will thicken that sauce.847  -   Good amount of olive oil, cause you wantit to brown really evenly.848  -   At this quite a high heat, becausewhat you wanna do is cook that veal849  -   so i s still pink in the middle.You see that golden brown?850  -   Tha s what  m after,which is beautiful.851  -   So because tha s only gonna takea few seconds,852  -    m gonna pop in garlic, whichis gonna crisp up,853  -   and  ve got some capers, that werein salt but are now rinsed.854  -   Sage leaves, plenty of them, and thena nice little chunk of butter,855  -   and  m just gonna allow it tofroth up around the veal.856  -   And once all tha s in and starting topermeate around the veal,857  -   i s only now that  m gonnaturn it over,858  -   because I know that all that flavo sworked its way around most of the surface859  -   of that presentation side.860  -   And then next in  m gonna throw insome cherry tomatoes,861  -   and this is gonna form a partof my sauce.862  -   All right, so veal out. And tha sstill pretty pink.863  -   Just gonna let that rest.864  -   And then what I want to do is justcook those tomatoes for a few seconds,865  -   and  m gonna actually just tryand crush a couple866  -   so that they bleed intothat butter.867  -   Then wine.868  -   And this is what I mean aboutbuilding the sauce in the pan869  -   and using that little bit ofthe flour off the veal,870  -   just to give you some whitein the sauce.871  -   And then tiny little bitof lemon juice.872  -   And then  ve got some littlebaby spinach leaves which873  -   are just gonna add a lovely color.And just toss it for a few seconds.874  -   And you can add a little bitof pepper, if you want.875  -   But essentially what  ve got is this lovelysauce made from the juices of the pan,876  -   the garlic tha s gonecrispy and golden,877  -   and then those crushed tomatoes.878  -   The vea s rested, sauce is made,smelling gorgeous,879  -   so what w re gonna do nowis plate it up.880  -   So all I do is just pop thison the plate.881  -   And then a few of these littleblistered cherry tomatoes.882  -   W ll put a lemon.883  -   And then just a drizzle of Georg sold mate, the olive oil.884  -   Alright?885  -   And tha s my interpretation of classicveal saltimbocca886  -   and a little sauce made from cherry tomatoesand garlic and from the juices in the pan.887  -   Okay, we need some tasters.888  -   Claire, Jake and Callum.889  -   Dig in.

Thanks, guys.896  -   So my three tips fora perfect saltimbocca.897  -   Choice of veal is absolutelycritical.898  -   If i s pre-tenderized it will be dry,especially if you overcook it.899  -   Tip number two, remember, veal does thave a lot of fat, cause i s young,900  -   so you have to cook it quicklyand keep it pink,901  -   otherwise it will be overcookedand very very dry.902  -   And tip number three, always thinkabout those juices in the pan903  -   and how easy it is to makea nice sauce out of that sediment.904  -   I s gonna make the world of differenceto your dish.905  -   When we come back, Peter Kuruvitadelves deeper into his seafood basket.906  -   And then just build it up slowly so thatyou get a really nice pile of marrons907  -   with this lovely sauce.908  -   W re at Flying Fishand w re doing crustaceans.909  -   The dish that  m doing nextis gonna be marron steamed with910  -   ginger chilli shallot sauce, which isa favorite in the restaurant,911  -   and has been on my menusfor probably twenty years.912  -   So welcome to somesecrets.913  -   Steamed marrons with gingerchilli shallot sauce914  -   This is a really easy sauce.Three chillies,915  -   chop the tops off, leave the seeds in,we want the heat, roughly chop.916  -   Next is garlic. Three clovesof garlic for this sauce.917  -   Again, roughly chopped.918  -   Three knobs of ginger. A knob of gingershould be about the size of your thumb.919  -   So roughly chop as well.920  -   Coriander, including roots, washed,make sure ther s nothing in there.921  -   And just chop it, leaves and all,so that yo re gonna have922  -   texture as well as the color.923  -   Spring onion.924  -   Just one of these, and this willgive you that oniony flavor,925  -   a little bit of the sweetnessas well.926  -   300 mils of soy sauce. Lightsoy sauce.927  -   300 mils of mirin. Mirin isa sweet sake,928  -   so that will add a little bitof viscosity to the dish929  -   and also when it cooks down, it willassist in the caramelization930  -   and the sweetness of it.931  -   250 mils of sweet chilli sauce.932  -   White wine to give it acid,and to break it down a little bit.933  -   Tha s 125 mils of white wine.934  -   And sesame oil.A 100 mils of that.935  -   Okay.

Just to makea small amount is quite hard.946  -   And  ve given this to peopleand they just use it on everything.947  -   You can use it in chicken, you canput it on prawns, or anything.948  -   It goes really wellwith pretty much anything.949  -   Alright, so.A taste.950  -   The only thing you can changeif you want to is the heat.951  -   But using the long red chillies,i s just right.952  -   Next is the marron itself.953  -   Now, the re beinghumanely killed954  -   by putting them intoice water until they go955  -   totally dead and then we cutthem in half.956  -   Sometimes you have to rememberthat they will move,957  -   there will be a twitching there,but they are dead.958  -   - Can you come and help me, my friend?- Sure. Absolutely.959  -    ll show you one, Peter, and thenyou can get into the rest of them.960  -   Now put it through the headand crunch down,961  -   and turn it around,and the same thing.962  -   When you get to the tail part,if yo re too slow,963  -   what will happen isyo ll crush it.964  -   So hand there,all the way through.965  -   Now, inside here arethe guts,966  -   and also you need to get outthe intestinal tract.967  -   And I want them put face upbecause I do t want968  -   the sauce to boil through them.969  -   What I want is the sauce to bein the bottom,970  -   and the marron is just nicelysteamed.

You canput more if you want,108  -   but this is nicely hot.109  -   Teaspoon of cumin.110  -   And a teaspoon of oregano,111  -   and about a tablespoonfulof brown sugar.112  -   And about a tablespoonfulof salt.113  -   Seems like a lot, but w ve gotat least a kilo and a half114  -   of ribs there.115  -   So tha s the basic rub.Give that a mix.116  -   And what w re gonna do is w regonna use the same basic ingredients117  -   in the actual barbecue sauceor braising liquid.118  -   And the whole idea is that the regonna cook for a period of time119  -   and all that braising liquid is gonna reducedown, get all sticky and then go on the rib.120  -   So basically chuck your ribs in,you can do a few at a time,121  -   and make sure i s just nicelyrubbed into the rib.122  -   Alright?123  -   And like I say, you can marinatethese and then pop them in the fridge.124  -   W re gonna pretend that thesehave been marinating for a couple of hours,125  -   and w re gonna put them ontothe barbecue to give them that charry126  -   smoky flavor. I s gonna give itquite a noticeable flavor,127  -   even though w re gonnabraise it afterwards.128  -   You ca t really,with this kind of meat,129  -   just barbecue it and expect itto be really tasty and morish.130  -   I s gonna be chewy, because ther sa lot of connective tissue on there,131  -   so tha s why it gotta gothrough the braise.132  -   Because what will happenin the fridge133  -   is that all those lovely paprikaand chilli powder and garlic134  -   all just gonna get into the meat.135  -   And i s amazing, how much differencethat marinade makes, actually.136  -   - All over?- Yep.137  -   Okay.138  -   And then w re gonna just putjust a little bit of oil139  -   just to help that outon the barbecue,140  -   and then w re gonna pop overto the barbecue and grill those.141  -   Carrie, thanks very much.Tha s your job done.142  -   And  ll just grill these for a fewminutes on each side.143  -   Nice and high,nice and hot.144  -   Just so we get that nicecharry flavor.145  -   Now you do t have to do this,you can put it on the griddle pan,146  -   or you can just roast it well147  -   in a roasting pan and pour allthe marinade over the top,148  -   but you will notice a difference.149  -   Because you do t have that charrinessof the grill and from the smoke.150  -   So there will be about three to fourminutes on each side,151  -   just to get that charriness.152  -   Okay, next up, w re gonnamake the sauce153  -   that the ribs are gonnabraise in.154  -   So w ve got a couple of extra ingredientson top of essentially the same spices155  -   that are in the rub,so nice and easy.156  -   So  ve got a cup of maltedvinegar.157  -   And this is to give youthe acidity.158  -   Because remember, you want sweetnessand acidity in any good barbecue rib.159  -   And then brown sugar, i s abouta cup of brown sugar.160  -   And then you got abouthalf a cup of bourbon.161  -   And then you got one onion,finely diced.162  -   You got one tomato, finely diced,just leave all the seeds in.163  -   Cause remember, this is all gonacollapse and break down.164  -   Two tablespoons of tomato sauce.165  -   Got about a tablespoonof Dijon mustard.166  -   W ve got a teaspon of cinnamon.167  -   Got a teaspoon of cumin.168  -   Got a teaspoon of chilli powder.169  -   So again, very similar tothe marinade.170  -   Teaspoon of smoked paprika.171  -   And then  ve got a teaspoonof mustard powder.172  -   Tha s English mustard powder.And a couple of bayleaves.173  -   And then I want a goodpinch of salt.174  -   About a teaspoon,teaspoon and a half.175  -   Next up, w re gonna putthe peel, or the zest from the orange.176  -   And this will caramelizeand break down,177  -   so tha s why  m putting it inin long strips,178  -   cause tha s gonna caramelizeas it cooks.179  -   What  m doing is just bringingthat mixture up to the boil,180  -   so when the ribs are cooked,the ve got that nice caramelization,181  -   the re gonna goin the resting tray,182  -   and then that hot marinade goesover the top.183  -   Putting in a jalapeno,seeds and all,184  -   tha s gonna add a bit of kickto the sauce.185  -   Just to infuse all thoseflavors,186  -   and what  m getting isthat sweet-sour187  -   and then a bit of thatchilli heat kicking through,188  -   so le s have a look atthese ribs.189  -   This is what  m after,  m afterthis nice charriness here.190  -   The re not far off.191  -   Right, nice non-stick heavy-dutyroasting pan. Important.192  -   And then in go the ribs.193  -   And the reason i s important,is that194  -   if you got a flimsybaking tray,195  -   it does t conduct the heat that well, youwant something like this, if you buy that,196  -   even though i s gonna be much moreexpensive than a flimsy roasting tray,197  -   i s gonna last you a lifetime,especially at home.198  -   I s important that you get a niceeven distribution of heat199  -   all through that dish.200  -   So, ribs have been grilled and le sput the sauce on.201  -   And then all w ve got to do ispour this lovely sweet and sour sauce202  -   over the top ofthe ribs.203  -   Look at all that. That looksabsolutely...204  -   Jeez, cleans your nose as well.Beautiful.205  -   So all tha s gonna happen is thisjust goes in for a206  -   bit of a slow braise for aboutan hour and a half207  -   until the re nice and soft.208  -   And how do you knowthe re nice and soft?209  -   Basically, you should be able topush the spoon through the flesh,210  -   or through the pork meatbetween the bones.211  -   And if you can push it through,then i s cooked.212  -   Cause it tells you that when youeat it, i s gonna be nice and tender.213  -   Right, now.214  -   These are gonna go into the ovenat about 195 degrees for an hour and a half.215  -   And the whole idea is that youturn those as the liquor starts to reduce216  -   and starts to caramelize,217  -   maybe three or four times duringthat hour and a half.218  -   And hopefully, at the end yo re gonnahave just enough sauce219  -   just to coat those ribs, to makethem nice and shiny, and sticky.220  -   Tha s all you need.221  -   After the break.222  -   Gary plates up hissticky ribs.223  -   Ok, so who wants to taste?224  -   And the all-American feastcontinues225  -   with Georg s classic Waldorf saladand easy mayonnaise.226  -   Wow, that looks great,George.227  -   W ve got the ribsnow in the oven228  -   and they need to cook for aboutan hour and a half229  -   so that the re nice and tender.230  -   In the meantime, George,what are you gonna make?231  -    m gonna make a simpleWaldorf salad,232  -   an inspiration from the Waldorfhotel in New York City.233  -   Wha s the essence of a good Waldorf?234  -   I think fresh apple,fresh celery,235  -   you know, walnuts,toasted walnuts,236  -   but a really deliciousand yummy mayonnaise.237  -   And tha s my job.238  -   Tha s your job cause youmake a great mayonnaise.239  -    ve been waiting to show youhow to make a simple mayonnaise.240  -   Why, because i s so easy. Do thave to buy it,241  -   and a few of you had problems.I s the whole emulsion,242  -   or the whole idea of the emulsionthat yo re having problems with.243  -   And the emulsion in a fresh egg mayonnaiseis the egg and the oil.244  -   And once you understandhow that all comes together,245  -   yo ll have confidence.246  -   Now somebody that did tdo too well was Alvin247  -   with your coleslaw.248  -   It is the first time h s mademayonnaise, you can tell,249  -   and tha s not the best coleslaw, ll be honest.250  -   So with that in mind, Alvin,come up,251  -   and yo re gonna help mewith the mayonnaise.252  -   Okay, Alvin, this is amazinglysimple, yo re gonna laugh.253  -   First of all, nice little blenderlike this, this little canister blender.254  -   I s very fast, instead ofhaving to use a whisk,255  -   which you can, you can cheatand use this baby.256  -   One tablespoon full of mustard,nice and heaped.257  -   Yep, good.258  -   Mustard is an emulsifier. So tha s gonnahelp emulsify the egg and the oil.259  -   Two whole eggs.260  -   Ah. Whole eggs, not justegg yolks.261  -   Lot of recipes require justegg yolks,262  -   tha s classic, but the egg whitehelps it bond and bind as well,263  -   and ther s nothing worse than havingrecipes with egg yolks only,264  -   cause what do you do withegg whites, right?265  -   Two tablespoons full ofsweet vinegar,266  -   in this case a white balsamic.267  -   And I like that little bit of sweetness,because a lot of bought mayonnaises268  -   got added sugar, peopleget used to that flavor,269  -   but i s actually quitenice.270  -   Cause i s the whole acidity and sweetnessthing at play again.271  -   Pinch of salt.272  -   Now because a blenderis so fast,273  -   unlike whisking by handwhich is slow,274  -   you can put a large amount of oilin to start off with275  -   cause the blades spin, bang, hundredsof times within the first few seconds.276  -    m gonna put a good measureof oil first.277  -   Click the lid on,start it off.278  -   And just give it ten seconds.279  -   Ten seconds, on.280  -   Can you see it coming together?281  -   Turn it off.282  -   You can see this is not split,even though i s thin,283  -   see how i s all emulsifiedtogether,284  -   so you can use that as goodindicator to put another285  -   quart of the oil in,turn it on.286  -   See how it smooths out there?Turn it off.287  -   Another third of the oil.288  -   Turn it on.289  -   And give it anotherthirty seconds.290  -   Same thing will happen.291  -   Now, see it?292  -   Tha s it.293  -   And again, you can havea look at it.294  -   See? I s nice and smooth.295  -   Add half of that.296  -   Turn on again.297  -   Looking beautiful.298  -   Okay, done.299  -   Now we want this really thick,alright?300  -   See wha s happening?301  -   I s so thick now that the machin shaving trouble just mixing it around.302  -   So remember that if yourmayonnaise looks particularly oily,303  -   you can add a little splash of wateror vinegar or lemon juice,304  -   just to sort of bring it together,because i s the water,305  -   that will also then act as sort ofa medium to allow it to emulsify.306  -   It becomes too oily,it will split.307  -   Turn it back on.308  -   Okay, done.309  -   Wow.310  -   Does that look a littlebit different to your mayonnaise?311  -   Just do t need eat the whole lot.But just try that.312  -   Tip your finger in it. And obviouslyyou can season that the way you want.313  -   Creamy.314  -   Really good.315  -   I s a great mayonnaise.316  -   I s just very simple. You can addwhatever flavor you want into it,317  -   but remember, use a little canisterblender like that, makes it very very easy.318  -    m not even gonna botherputting it into a container.319  -    m done,  ll see you in a minutewith your Waldorf salad.320  -   - Ciao.- Cheers, mate.321  -   Right, so Waldorf salad.322  -   The essence of the Waldorf saladis the acidity and sweetness of that apple,323  -   and the mayonnaise.324  -   So w re gonna really accentuatethose elements.325  -   The apple, I wanna put a couplelittle textures on there,326  -   so  m gonna make a simpleapple jelly,327  -   and as well as that,fresh apple on the plate.328  -   So to make the apple jelly, Adam,come up, join me,329  -   le s make it together, mate.330  -   I think for me when I make anytype of fruit jelly,331  -   i s all about the fruit.332  -   If i s apple, all I wanna putinto it is apple.333  -   I do t wanna start fussing it around toomuch with adding other elements,334  -   other flavors.335  -   Using the juicer you can leech outall those beautiful flavors.336  -   So the first step is to makeapple juice.337  -    m using green apples because I thinkthe ve got a real lovely tartness to them.338  -   As well as sweetness, ther s thissort of bitterness and sharpness about them,339  -   that I really love.340  -   W re just gonna quickly removethat pith, and the pips.341  -   The pips are bitter, and they are tgonna add beautiful flavor to it.342  -   You ever made a jelly before,Adam?343  -   I have actually,on the weekend.344  -   - What did you make?- Maple syrup jelly.345  -   Yum, delicious.346  -   Okay, next step, squeeze a lemon, so itdoes t oxidize or go brown, the apple.347  -   Next step, juicer.348  -   Pop all your apples in, and thenput the lid on and then turn it on.349  -   Sure.350  -   Joanne, you got a question?351  -   If you do t have a juicer, can youuse like a good organic juice? Apple juice?352  -   Nothing saying you ca t.I just love freshly squeezed juice.353  -   I think ther s just nothing better.- Yeah.354  -   Beautiful. Fantastic.355  -   So we set that aside. Next stepis to soak our gelatin.356  -   For 500 mils of apple juice,w ve got four sheets of gelatin.357  -   We need to soak the gelatin.358  -   Look, I prefer to use gold leaf gelatin,i s a refined product.359  -   I s top notch, i s the A grade stuff.360  -   You can use powdered gelatin,if you prefer.361  -   Adam, thank you, mate.- Thanks, George.362  -   Right guys, our gelatin has beensoaking in water.363  -   And w re just gonna pop thatinto a pan,364  -   and then with a little bit of the juicew re just gonna temper the gelatin.365  -   And I only do that with a little bitof the juice,366  -   I do t do it with all of it. I do twanna boil this, okay?367  -   The flavor is complete for me. If Iboil it,  m gonna affect its flavor.368  -   And generally what you do, when youboil something or cook something369  -   so delicate like that, you sendall that flavor into the air.370  -   I want it in there. I do twanna lose that.371  -    m just gonna parse this liquid now,as you can see i s starting to separate.372  -   So w ve got froth on the top,and all the juice on the bottom.373  -   So as you can see, our gelatinis melting in with that little bit of juice374  -   of the apple that we added in there.375  -   Now  m gonna add thismelted gelatin into my apple mixture,376  -   and just stir that through.377  -   Then this goes into a tray.378  -   This will take about an hourto two hours to set in a fridge.379  -   Because we have t gotmuch time380  -    m going to pop that jelly intothe blast freezer381  -   and chill it down as quicklyas possible.382  -   Right guys, the next step.383  -   Gary made this beautiful mayonnaise,and what  m gonna add to it384  -   is some onion, sweet and sour.385  -   This is ultra, ultra simple,okay?386  -   One onion, finely diced.387  -   You do t need oil.388  -   Sugar. One,389  -   two,390  -   and a half tablespoonsof sugar.391  -   In keeping with the theme of the Waldorfsalad,  m using a cider vinegar,392  -   probably about half a cup.393  -   Gas, a nice sort ofmedium heat.394  -   Now this is what our onionswill look like after 20 minutes.395  -   Ther s no color, the re justnice and translucent,396  -   and sort of goldenish.397  -   As you can see, ther s not muchliquid left at all.398  -   I s all dissolved pretty much.399  -   So  m gonna add a couple of spoonsof this delicious mayonnaise Gary made.400  -   One,401  -   two,402  -   and that forms the dressingto our Waldorf salad.403  -   Onion mayonnaise,sweet and sour.404  -   Right, I want to put some freshgreen apple on there.405  -   And I just wanna do nice,thin slices,406  -   that  m going to presenton the plate.407  -   And just a little bit of lemon juiceover the top,408  -   so it does t oxidize or go brown,the apple.409  -   Right,  m gonna toast some walnutsand I think, again,410  -   the walnuts are a crucial elementto the Waldorf salad.411  -   So we throw a few of thesewalnuts into a pan.412  -   And  m just gonna sugar them lightly413  -   and just sort of dry roastthem in the pan. Okay?414  -   A little pinch of salt,tha s as simple as that.415  -   Right, le s plate up.416  -   So, first of all, our sweet and souronion mayonnaise.417  -   So blob,418  -   blob,419  -   and then some apples.420  -   Few up like that.421  -   Few up like that.422  -   Then some of our little babycos leaves, just gorgeous,423  -   I wanna show these off.424  -   Some celery.425  -   Just gonna stand these up, and again,show them off, cause the re just beautiful.426  -   Then some walnuts.427  -   Next up is these beautifulnasturtium leaves.428  -   You can buy these from anygood nursery, these nasturtium leaves.429  -   Next, some of these frisee,w re just gonna scatter that around.430  -   I s starting to lookreally beautiful.431  -   Great, jelly set.432  -   And  m simply just gonna scoopsome nodules out of jelly433  -   and just pop that on the plate.434  -   Without any fuss, does t needto be cubes or squares.435  -   And then finally, a bit of the old fella,my mate olive oil,436  -   and some of Gar s mate,salt.437  -   Right guys, so her s my interpretationof a Waldorf salad.438  -   Wow, that looks great,George.439  -   Now for the ribs.What a contrast.440  -   Beer ribs and your beautifulsalad.

This is my restaurantFlying Fish. Welcome.512  -    m co-owner andhead chef here,513  -   as well as being part ofFlying Fish Fiji514  -   at the Sheraton Andy.515  -    ve been in the industryabout 31 years.516  -   The thing that defines Flying Fishis our little twist on Sri Lankan flavors.517  -   The cooking style could easily bedescribed as518  -   seafood cooked simply,served elegantly,519  -   in a beautiful surrounding.520  -   You guys have done a mystery boxa few days ago521  -   and the main ingredient wasmud crab, I heard.522  -   Yes.523  -   Some of you got right into it.Some of you had to play and524  -   other people did t eventouch it.525  -   Crustaceans are just amazing thingsand George and Gary have asked me to526  -   come and tell you a little bitabout them and hopefully get you527  -   over those barriers andhopefully I can give you528  -   a bit of an edge onthe rest of them as well.529  -   What  m gonna do today530  -   is show you two really simple,tasty dishes531  -   using a West Australian marron.532  -   But first,  m gonna take you throughthe world of crustaceans.533  -    m gonna start with prawns. Prawnsare available in hundreds of species.534  -   You can buy them on the markets green,which is uncooked, or cooked.535  -   Fresh prawns do t really lastbecause a prawn has an enzyme in it536  -   which actually keeps growingwhen the prawn dies.537  -   The head goes black and the headwill start to droop.538  -   So a frozen prawn is better.539  -   Yo re better off taking it home,defrosting it under clean running water.540  -   First, school prawns, you canbuy them green or cooked,541  -   then, lightly floured,pan fried or deep fried542  -   with a bit of aioli, lemon juice,really, tha s all you need.543  -   You can eat it all as well.544  -   The cooked ones are greatfor barbecues,545  -   just give them to your guestswith a finger bowl and a cloth.546  -   The king of all prawns for Australiais the Eastern King.547  -   I s got beautiful flesh, i swonderfully flavored,548  -   and when you cook it, it staysnice and firm.549  -   Take you next into the world of crabs,now crabs,  ll be back in a minute.550  -   This guy nearly got me.551  -   Tha s a Queensland mud crab.552  -   When you feel for a crab,when you pick up a crab,553  -   fingers underneathand hold it like that554  -   and hope to hell that i s tight,because that yo ll lose your finger,555  -   that will take your finger off no problem,or crush it very badly.556  -   You hold them quite tight, and if youroll them over you can feel the weight.557  -   Ther s another train of thoughtwhere if you squeeze this back flipper,558  -   should be nice and firm as well.559  -   Look at this guy.560  -   This is actually just knownas a giant crab.561  -   They grow to another seven to eightkilos with claws the size of my arm.562  -   And the way to eat these is enjoy itin a restaurant with about ten friends.563  -   It costs you a lot less,and what will happen564  -   is that the ll bring it out to youin about ten courses.565  -   So yo ll start with the soup,then fried with noodles, then the claws,566  -   i s just a wonderful way to eat.567  -   Crustaceans is all about familyand friends568  -   and being with a group of people.569  -   All right, next cra sthe beautiful blue swimmer.570  -   Cooked and green or blue. One of theonly crustaceans that do t come live.571  -   They do t survive very wellout of the water.572  -   Good in Thai curries. One of the bestcurries  ve ever had573  -   was the Thai yellow curry sittingon a beach in Thailand with a beer.574  -   You could steam them,take the meat out,575  -   but if yo re gonna do that,buy these cooked, guys.576  -   All right, her s an exciting577  -   development in the worldof Australian aquaculture.578  -   Soft-shell crabs are amazingbecause you can eat the whole shell.579  -   These guys are great to cookin handrolls like the Japanese do.580  -   The Americans crumb them.581  -   I just prefer battered, like a bitof tempura batter. Deep fried.582  -   Again, really crisp and nice,583  -   and the sensation of eating a wholecrab, shell and all but also584  -   beautiful flavors and sweet,lovely flesh.585  -   OK, I have a live southern rocklobster and a live local lobster.586  -   You can tell the re very different.587  -   The local lobster comes from the southcoast of New South Wales, around Ulladulla.588  -   Southern rock lobster is foundall the way around the coastline,589  -   probably from Queensland all the waydown to Western Australia.590  -   Varieties change, the species change, butthe southern rock lobster is the prized one.591  -   I s prized for the flavor of its flesh,i s prized for its size, and also592  -   for the way that the flesh cooks.593  -   I s beautiful and soft and italso makes wonderful sashimi.594  -   On the freshwater side, ther s a fewothers that  d like to show you.595  -   Ther s a marron, which is whatwe are using today.596  -   And this is, as I said, fromWestern Australia,597  -   and really one of the trueindigenous species of Australia.598  -   And a yabby.599  -   The thing about freshwater fish thoughis the re probably a little bit600  -   short on the flavor.601  -   They have a nice sweetness,602  -   but you really need to think when yo recooking with freshwater crayfish603  -   about what yo ll combineto enhance the flavor.604  -   And I think i s up to youwhich way you want to go.605  -   I feel that tha s the king, and i sreally one of the most beautiful creatures.606  -   And the color of the shell, once i scooked, i s stunning.607  -   These guys in salads are beautiful, as longas yo re really careful with how,608  -   what you put it in withand how you cook it.609  -   All right, finally, bugs.610  -   Now, most people do t like to eat bugs,but bugs ar ethese wonderful creatures.611  -   Ther s about five varieties.612  -   The one with the wide, round headis a balmain bug.613  -   The thing about a balmain bugis it has a very,614  -   very distinctive flavor.615  -   Some people dislike it immensely,others love it.616  -   So if you do t like the strength of theflavor, then you go for a Moreton Bay bug.617  -   But as a cooked product,this is great.618  -   Live, chill them down, and thenuse them in salads or stir fries.619  -   I have to tell you one more thing.All of this stuff, the re all animals.620  -   The re all creatures, and a lot of themare best live.621  -   So you need to dispatchwith these creatures humanely.622  -   I s a big part of it, you know.623  -   The most humane way to do itis to chill them.624  -   So that means, put them in the bagthat you get them from,625  -   into the freezer. Do t let them freezebecause it will break down the flesh.626  -   But it needs to get to the stage, wherethey are actually just very slow.627  -   Once the ve come out of the freezer,they are virtually incapacitated628  -   and they wo t be feeling pain.So do it very quickly.629  -   Cut them directly in half.630  -   The other way to do is buy themat the markets and the ll kill it for you.631  -   If you bring a big pot of water to boiland you put a crustacean into it,632  -   it does t matter what size it is,and you cook it for eight to nine minutes,633  -   yo ll find that i s always perfect.634  -   When we return.635  -   Quite easy just to crack them with yourfingers and then break them open.636  -   Peter reveals the simplicityof his showstopping marron salad.637  -   All about sensation, tha swhat food is all about.638  -   This dish is a salad of marron,shaved fennel,639  -   avruga and Asian dressing.640  -   I s really simple, i s light,and i s all about flavors.641  -   First off, starting with the sauce,ther s a few classic techniques.642  -   Firstly, julienne.643  -   You just slice the chilliall the way down the middle644  -   and then you need to flatten it up,take the seeds out first,645  -   but then to get really, reallynice julienne,646  -   you actually need to takea lot of the flesh away,647  -   because what you wanna do is justhave the skin.648  -   So by placing a knife downlike that,649  -   having your fingers nice and flatin case you slip,650  -   and just shaving a perfectlittle piece off the chilli.651  -   And then let your knifejust slide over.652  -   So, tha s a julienne, going toput that into here.653  -   Next will be a chiffonade.I s like a julienne but654  -   you usually use itfor leaves.655  -   You want a really fine garnish if yo remaking a soup or something like that,656  -   and you want to put some leavesthrough it,657  -   to chiffonade them isa great way to do it.658  -   So take all the stems off,659  -   and w re doing it with justone stalk of coriander.660  -    m also going to use for flavorthe root of the coriander.661  -   So  m just gonna take onecoriander root.662  -   We want to extract all the flavor,just bang it and then chop it.663  -   People throw the very endof the root away but664  -   if you know Thai cuisine,tha s where the flavor is.665  -   That goes into the plate.666  -   Now, chiffonade. You can putall the leaves together.667  -   Very fine again, i s all about colorand you notice too that668  -    ve got no liquids in therebecause this is a very fresh dressing.669  -   If I put all the liquids in, which arequite strong flavors,670  -   wha s gonna happen is thateverything will wilt,671  -   the colors will go and i s notgonna be as nice to eat.672  -   So next is brunois.Tha s a fine dice, so673  -   to get the finest dice, slice downas close as you possibly can.674  -   Halfway, and then one more time,so yo re doing three cuts into the onion.675  -   And then, just again, a nice dicestraight through.676  -   And  ll throw that in as well.677  -   Next is garlic, crushed garlic.678  -   You crush garlic like this, yo re reallygetting all the essence out of it.679  -   Just remember that yo vedone it on this board680  -   before you have your vegemiteand toast in the morning,681  -   tha s not the best.682  -   All right, so next is spring onion.683  -    m not using the leaves, ve got my green in there684  -   and I do t really need it, what  mafter is the real flavor from this.685  -   And then, doing a rough julienne.686  -   Turning it around, and finelydicing it.687  -   Textur s really important in food,i s how it feels in your mouth,688  -   i s like wine or anything,i s all that sensation,689  -   tha s what foo s all about.690  -   Next we have to have twobeautiful limes.691  -   Just give it a nice roll, okay?692  -   Yo re gonna loosen up all the littlecells in there693  -   and yo ll get more juice out of it,so you get value for money.694  -   Using a microplane, I just wannaget the zest695  -   by using as much of two limesas you can.696  -   Okay, so just juicing them. Juice andzests make two different flavors.697  -   The zest has that really oily, beautifulcitric sort of flavor,698  -   but it does t have the acid, and thenyou add the juice too699  -   and it sort of brings it up and gives youthat beautiful citric acid as well.700  -   A fifty grams of brown sugar,adds a sweetness,701  -   stir this through, i s really importantthat it dissolves,702  -   that you do t have any solidbits of sugar in there.703  -   Brown sugar has more molasses in it,so you get that beautiful caramely flavor.704  -   So the lime and brown sugar,about 30 mils of fish sauce,705  -    m saying about because the concentrationof salt in fish sauce changes.706  -   So you start with that and thenadd more,707  -   i s very hard to take out salt,one of those ones708  -   tha s very very very hardto remove.709  -   Put less than you think,add at the end,710  -   and that way yo re gonna end upwith a much better result.711  -   Five mils of soy sauce, measure this,try and use light soy sauce712  -   cause we do t wanna be addingtoo much salt.713  -   Just make sure all the sugaris dissolved,714  -   add it to your ingredients715  -   and stir.716  -   Now i s time to taste,now i s time to balance.717  -   Try not to double dip when youtaste as well.718  -   Perfect.719  -    m lucky this time.720  -   But try to get it right the first coupleof times, because with strong sauces,721  -   once yo ve tasted it a few times,you ca t taste anything.722  -   But now tha s fresh, i s crunchy,ready to go, so  m gonna put it to side,723  -   the next stage is garnish.724  -   So, grapes.725  -    m using flame grapes,because they have no seeds.726  -   Ther s another little garnishI have, which is just chives.727  -   And then all w re doing is justcutting some batons.728  -   This is a pretty part of it.729  -   Shave fennel, a mandolin or a verysharp knife.730  -   Three more ingredients.731  -   First one, and I have to use it,flying fish roe.732  -   We are at Flying Fish. But the reasonI love to use this,733  -   Japanese use it and most peopleuse it for the same reason,734  -   and that is a crunch, a greattexture and a beautiful flavor as well.735  -    m also gonna use avruga.736  -   Now avruga has an amazinglysmoky flavor.737  -   But i s actually not caviar.It looks like it, but i s fish,738  -   which has been ground up and thenmade to look like fish eggs,739  -   and flavored with a littlebit of smoke.740  -   And lastly, sumac. Anyone knowwhat sumac is?741  -   Kind of some... Middle-Easterncultures use it a lot.742  -   Yeah, it gives anothersensation.743  -   The last thing we have to do now,is clean the cooked marrons.744  -   Very simple. Push the shell in,and twist it.745  -   And then you get all of it.746  -   Let me do one of the claws, so youbreak them off at the first knuckle.747  -   Next, removing the shell. I s quiteeasy, just crack them with your fingers,748  -   and then break them open.749  -   And what yo re trying to dois to get the piece of meat out750  -   intact, looking lovely.Okay?751  -   Next stage, using the heel of your knife,just crack it lightly,752  -   and peel that off, so that you havea whole claw intact,753  -   and that really is just a garnish.754  -   Next, just cutting it downthe middle,755  -   and here yo ll see theintestinal tract.756  -   Just take it out, and squarethem off757  -   so that i s gonna looklovely.758  -   For each one of these dishesI am just using five pieces.759  -   Now, to plate it.760  -   The fennel with the sauce,two spoonfuls of that into it.761  -   W ll get a nice mix.762  -   One bowl is enough for four serves.763  -   Little bit of fennel in the bottom.764  -   And now  m just gonna buildit with marron.765  -   The next, the sauce.766  -   Just another little spoonfulon top.767  -   Next is the avruga, one nice spoonfulwill allow the smokiness of this come out.768  -   Just on top.769  -   Followed by three pieces of grape.Just for visual effect.770  -   Next, sumac.771  -   And next, flying fish roe. A greatsensation as far as textur s concerned.772  -   Nice flavors as well. The next isthe claws, just surround the outside.773  -   Something else for people to bite.774  -   And then a garnish of chive.775  -   So tha s it guys, salad of marron,shaved fennel, and avruga. Asian dressing.776  -   Come up and taste.777  -   So visually, lots of colors,there should be lots of flavors there too,778  -   and I suggest you get a little bit ofeverything on your spork an have a try,779  -   so please.780  -    m someone that does t likereally strong flavored seafood,781  -   but I love the marron, becauseit is quite subtle,782  -   and then it really complementsputting the grapes with it783  -   is a really lovely complement, becausei s a little bit sweet too.784  -   Oh, thank you.785  -   So ther s three tips that I thinkyou should always use786  -   when you make a dish like this.787  -   Firstly, fresh seafood. Make friendswith your fishmonger.788  -   The most vital thing, you ca t takesalt out. So just make sure789  -   that you add a little bit lessand then finish it off by tasting it.790  -   And the last of course, keep it simple.Look after your flavors,791  -   and people always enjoy your food.792  -   Up next,Gary goes Italian793  -   with a flavor packed renditionof veal saltimbocca.794  -   What you wanna do is cook that vealso i s still pink in the middle.795  -   And a little later.796  -   Tha s looking beautiful, look howshiny tha s looking.797  -   George presents an elegant dessert treat.White mousse canelloni.798  -   I love it.  m goingto make that.799  -   Next up in MasterClass, w re goingto do an Italian classic using veal,800  -   which is veal saltimbocca.801  -   What veal saltimbocca isis veal802  -   wrapped in pancetta orprosciutto with sage.803  -   So I need a helper for this one.804  -   Callum, can you come upand give me a hand?805  -   Sure.806  -   This is a pretty expensivepiece of veal.807  -   First up w re just gonna take offthe scotch essentially from the rib.808  -   What I wanna do is cut littlesteaks from this, little scallops,809  -   that are about 120 gramsor so,810  -   which w re gonna batout lightly.811  -   All right, Callum? If you can stretch outa bit of that clean film,812  -   and then just pop those rightin the middle and equidistant apart813  -   and then put another layerover the top,814  -   and  ll show youthe first one.815  -   When you bat something out,yo re not whacking it randomly,816  -   just trying very lightly,work in nice neat lines,817  -   I need to work across and then up,or up and then across,818  -   but work in a methodical fashion.Be very gentle.819  -   Hold the hammer close to the headof the hammer,820  -   so that yo re not putting inenormous amount of weight on,821  -   and then yo ve got some control.822  -   Just very gentle, yeah?823  -   Yeah, perfect.Brilliant.824  -   Le s do the next phase, and tha s wrappingthese little babies up with the sage.825  -   Yo re just gonna put theseslices down.826  -   This is the pancetta.827  -   And then what w re gonna do is puttwo nice leaves of sage on each of the veal.828  -   Face up like that.829  -   Just press them downonto the meat.830  -   And what that sage is going to dois put flavor into that veal.831  -   And then kind of what you want to dois just put these832  -   upside down and then wrap themquite tightly and so that the ve stuck833  -   and you get that little piece ofveal like that. Alright?834  -   The term saltimbocca meansleap in your mouth or jump in your mouth835  -   which is really interesting because we sayveal saltimbocca and it sounds beautiful836  -   whereas if we put veal jump inyour mouth on the menu,837  -   noone would buy it. Alright.Thanks for that.838  -   You can go and havea little seat.839  -   Next stage in the saltimbocca,you do t have to do this,840  -   but i s a little dusting of flour.So  m gonna put some pepper and salt.841  -   onto the flour just to season it,and then what I wanna do842  -   is just very lightly dip that in,843  -   and all this will do is it will giveyou a lovely golden brown finish844  -   on the saltimbocca. And also, m gonna deglaze the pan845  -   and make a little sauce in it, and it willleave a little flour residue in the pan,846  -   which will thicken that sauce.847  -   Good amount of olive oil, cause you wantit to brown really evenly.848  -   At this quite a high heat, becausewhat you wanna do is cook that veal849  -   so i s still pink in the middle.You see that golden brown?850  -   Tha s what  m after,which is beautiful.851  -   So because tha s only gonna takea few seconds,852  -    m gonna pop in garlic, whichis gonna crisp up,853  -   and  ve got some capers, that werein salt but are now rinsed.854  -   Sage leaves, plenty of them, and thena nice little chunk of butter,855  -   and  m just gonna allow it tofroth up around the veal.856  -   And once all tha s in and starting topermeate around the veal,857  -   i s only now that  m gonnaturn it over,858  -   because I know that all that flavo sworked its way around most of the surface859  -   of that presentation side.860  -   And then next in  m gonna throw insome cherry tomatoes,861  -   and this is gonna form a partof my sauce.862  -   All right, so veal out. And tha sstill pretty pink.863  -   Just gonna let that rest.864  -   And then what I want to do is justcook those tomatoes for a few seconds,865  -   and  m gonna actually just tryand crush a couple866  -   so that they bleed intothat butter.867  -   Then wine.868  -   And this is what I mean aboutbuilding the sauce in the pan869  -   and using that little bit ofthe flour off the veal,870  -   just to give you some whitein the sauce.871  -   And then tiny little bitof lemon juice.872  -   And then  ve got some littlebaby spinach leaves which873  -   are just gonna add a lovely color.And just toss it for a few seconds.874  -   And you can add a little bitof pepper, if you want.875  -   But essentially what  ve got is this lovelysauce made from the juices of the pan,876  -   the garlic tha s gonecrispy and golden,877  -   and then those crushed tomatoes.878  -   The vea s rested, sauce is made,smelling gorgeous,879  -   so what w re gonna do nowis plate it up.880  -   So all I do is just pop thison the plate.881  -   And then a few of these littleblistered cherry tomatoes.882  -   W ll put a lemon.883  -   And then just a drizzle of Georg sold mate, the olive oil.884  -   Alright?885  -   And tha s my interpretation of classicveal saltimbocca886  -   and a little sauce made from cherry tomatoesand garlic and from the juices in the pan.887  -   Okay, we need some tasters.888  -   Claire, Jake and Callum.889  -   Dig in. Tell me what you think.890  -   Sage is awesome.891  -   I love that crispiness,the good juiciness of the tomatoes,892  -   i s really good.- Gives a little freshness to it.893  -   The sage is milder than I wasexpecting it to be.894  -   I love it, i s really good.895  -   Beautiful. Thanks, guys.896  -   So my three tips fora perfect saltimbocca.897  -   Choice of veal is absolutelycritical.898  -   If i s pre-tenderized it will be dry,especially if you overcook it.899  -   Tip number two, remember, veal does thave a lot of fat, cause i s young,900  -   so you have to cook it quicklyand keep it pink,901  -   otherwise it will be overcookedand very very dry.902  -   And tip number three, always thinkabout those juices in the pan903  -   and how easy it is to makea nice sauce out of that sediment.904  -   I s gonna make the world of differenceto your dish.905  -   When we come back, Peter Kuruvitadelves deeper into his seafood basket.906  -   And then just build it up slowly so thatyou get a really nice pile of marrons907  -   with this lovely sauce.908  -   W re at Flying Fishand w re doing crustaceans.909  -   The dish that  m doing nextis gonna be marron steamed with910  -   ginger chilli shallot sauce, which isa favorite in the restaurant,911  -   and has been on my menusfor probably twenty years.912  -   So welcome to somesecrets.913  -   Steamed marrons with gingerchilli shallot sauce914  -   This is a really easy sauce.Three chillies,915  -   chop the tops off, leave the seeds in,we want the heat, roughly chop.916  -   Next is garlic. Three clovesof garlic for this sauce.917  -   Again, roughly chopped.918  -   Three knobs of ginger. A knob of gingershould be about the size of your thumb.919  -   So roughly chop as well.920  -   Coriander, including roots, washed,make sure ther s nothing in there.921  -   And just chop it, leaves and all,so that yo re gonna have922  -   texture as well as the color.923  -   Spring onion.924  -   Just one of these, and this willgive you that oniony flavor,925  -   a little bit of the sweetnessas well.926  -   300 mils of soy sauce. Lightsoy sauce.927  -   300 mils of mirin. Mirin isa sweet sake,928  -   so that will add a little bitof viscosity to the dish929  -   and also when it cooks down, it willassist in the caramelization930  -   and the sweetness of it.931  -   250 mils of sweet chilli sauce.932  -   White wine to give it acid,and to break it down a little bit.933  -   Tha s 125 mils of white wine.934  -   And sesame oil.A 100 mils of that.935  -   Okay. Next stage isvery easy.936  -   Put the lid on, pulse ita few times,937  -   and once it gets going...938  -   Blend it up really well,it does t take long.939  -   And tha s it. Ther syour sauce.940  -   I s easy to make andvery tasty.941  -   - Pete?- Yeah?942  -   If yo re gonna make that sauce in advance,how long can you keep that for?943  -   Because of all the ingredientsthat I put in,944  -   i ll hold for three to sixweeks.945  -   So make up a batch. Just to makea small amount is quite hard.946  -   And  ve given this to peopleand they just use it on everything.947  -   You can use it in chicken, you canput it on prawns, or anything.948  -   It goes really wellwith pretty much anything.949  -   Alright, so.A taste.950  -   The only thing you can changeif you want to is the heat.951  -   But using the long red chillies,i s just right.952  -   Next is the marron itself.953  -   Now, the re beinghumanely killed954  -   by putting them intoice water until they go955  -   totally dead and then we cutthem in half.956  -   Sometimes you have to rememberthat they will move,957  -   there will be a twitching there,but they are dead.958  -   - Can you come and help me, my friend?- Sure. Absolutely.959  -    ll show you one, Peter, and thenyou can get into the rest of them.960  -   Now put it through the headand crunch down,961  -   and turn it around,and the same thing.962  -   When you get to the tail part,if yo re too slow,963  -   what will happen isyo ll crush it.964  -   So hand there,all the way through.965  -   Now, inside here arethe guts,966  -   and also you need to get outthe intestinal tract.967  -   And I want them put face upbecause I do t want968  -   the sauce to boil through them.969  -   What I want is the sauce to bein the bottom,970  -   and the marron is just nicelysteamed. Wanna have a go?971  -   Okay, yeah. So be strong, becausewhen you back off972  -   when yo re a bit concerned,tha s when yo re gonna slip.973  -   Hold it firmly, push into it.Tha s it, all the way down, nice and fast.974  -   Now turn the marron around.- You flip the tail around yeah?975  -   Yes, have it nice and flat,otherwise yo re gonna crush the shell.976  -   Tha s it.977  -   Great.978  -   - That tract is going out...- It will come out.979  -   With your crustaceans oreven fish, do t wash them.980  -   You see people opening oystersand then wash the oyster.981  -   Yo ve lost the beautyof the oyster, you know?982  -   Oyster comes from South Coastsomewhere, you want to taste that river.983  -   So Peter, for instance,is that okay?984  -   Tha s fine.I s pretty simple, is t it?985  -   I s all about flavorsand freshness.986  -   The meat in this marronis nice and firm,987  -   and tha s the thing about havinglive crustaceans.988  -   I s that a lot of them do nottransport very well once the re dead.989  -   So i s kind of necessary to enjoythe best that a crustacean has.990  -   Thank you, sir. The restof it is easy.991  -   So lastly,  m going to putthe sauce in, but992  -   the sauce, as you can see,has started to separate.993  -   So this sauce, even if you keep itfor a long time,994  -   make sure you stir it beforeyou use it every time.995  -   Then w re just gonna pourabout half of this sauce on,996  -   and then we cook it.997  -   So a lid, some heat.998  -   With these, ten minutesmaximum.999  -   Hot stove, bring itto the boil,1000  -   when i s halfway through,just take it off and check.1001  -   And never let the saucereduce too much.1002  -   You let the sauce reduce too much,it will caramelize and burn.1003  -   You wo t have that lovelygolden color.1004  -   And nothing worse thanburnt food.1005  -   All right, guys, ten minuteshas gone.1006  -   Le s see what the re like.1007  -   The ve turned color, got thatlovely orange glow to them.1008  -   And the aroma that comesoff is great.1009  -   So le s serve it up.What you wanna do here1010  -   is build the height. So get yourselfa really nice base first,1011  -   and then just build it up slowlyso that yo ve got a really nice pile1012  -   of marrons with thislovely sauce.1013  -   Make them cometo a nice pinnacle.1014  -   And then sauce.1015  -   Try and have the sauce just run downin a nice pool of sauce at the bottom.1016  -   And the last stage, of course,is to garnish it.1017  -   Got lots of red there, so  m justgonna put a little bit of coriander into it1018  -   right at the end.1019  -   Tha s it.1020  -   Marrons, ginger chilli shallot saucefrom Flying Fish.1021  -   Come and taste it.1022  -   Let me serve you.1023  -   Yeah, goes well.1024  -   That is such a beautiful texture.1025  -   I s just the right amountof chilli as well.1026  -   Got to remember, too, with marrons,the re not that flavorsome.1027  -   They have a very subtle flavor,so this sort of enhances it.1028  -   I s a great carrier of flavors,but it does t overpower,1029  -   and i s just a great wayto eat crustaceans.1030  -   Glad you enjoy it.- I s delicious.1031  -   Couple of tips. Number one,1032  -   ensure that when you cut them in half,you take out the intestinal tract1033  -   and clean the gut.1034  -   When yo re cooking them,do t turn them at all1035  -   and ensure that they just steam so thatyou can still taste the marron itself.1036  -   And lastly, presentation.Make it stand nice and high,1037  -   give them a finger bowl,make people feel okay1038  -   to eat with their fingers.1039  -   Good luck in the rest of the competition.- Thank you.1040  -   I hope this helps you.

You canput more if you want,108  -   but this is nicely hot.109  -   Teaspoon of cumin.110  -   And a teaspoon of oregano,111  -   and about a tablespoonfulof brown sugar.112  -   And about a tablespoonfulof salt.113  -   Seems like a lot, but w ve gotat least a kilo and a half114  -   of ribs there.115  -   So tha s the basic rub.Give that a mix.116  -   And what w re gonna do is w regonna use the same basic ingredients117  -   in the actual barbecue sauceor braising liquid.118  -   And the whole idea is that the regonna cook for a period of time119  -   and all that braising liquid is gonna reducedown, get all sticky and then go on the rib.120  -   So basically chuck your ribs in,you can do a few at a time,121  -   and make sure i s just nicelyrubbed into the rib.122  -   Alright?123  -   And like I say, you can marinatethese and then pop them in the fridge.124  -   W re gonna pretend that thesehave been marinating for a couple of hours,125  -   and w re gonna put them ontothe barbecue to give them that charry126  -   smoky flavor. I s gonna give itquite a noticeable flavor,127  -   even though w re gonnabraise it afterwards.128  -   You ca t really,with this kind of meat,129  -   just barbecue it and expect itto be really tasty and morish.130  -   I s gonna be chewy, because ther sa lot of connective tissue on there,131  -   so tha s why it gotta gothrough the braise.132  -   Because what will happenin the fridge133  -   is that all those lovely paprikaand chilli powder and garlic134  -   all just gonna get into the meat.135  -   And i s amazing, how much differencethat marinade makes, actually.136  -   - All over?- Yep.137  -   Okay.138  -   And then w re gonna just putjust a little bit of oil139  -   just to help that outon the barbecue,140  -   and then w re gonna pop overto the barbecue and grill those.141  -   Carrie, thanks very much.Tha s your job done.142  -   And  ll just grill these for a fewminutes on each side.143  -   Nice and high,nice and hot.144  -   Just so we get that nicecharry flavor.145  -   Now you do t have to do this,you can put it on the griddle pan,146  -   or you can just roast it well147  -   in a roasting pan and pour allthe marinade over the top,148  -   but you will notice a difference.149  -   Because you do t have that charrinessof the grill and from the smoke.150  -   So there will be about three to fourminutes on each side,151  -   just to get that charriness.152  -   Okay, next up, w re gonnamake the sauce153  -   that the ribs are gonnabraise in.154  -   So w ve got a couple of extra ingredientson top of essentially the same spices155  -   that are in the rub,so nice and easy.156  -   So  ve got a cup of maltedvinegar.157  -   And this is to give youthe acidity.158  -   Because remember, you want sweetnessand acidity in any good barbecue rib.159  -   And then brown sugar, i s abouta cup of brown sugar.160  -   And then you got abouthalf a cup of bourbon.161  -   And then you got one onion,finely diced.162  -   You got one tomato, finely diced,just leave all the seeds in.163  -   Cause remember, this is all gonacollapse and break down.164  -   Two tablespoons of tomato sauce.165  -   Got about a tablespoonof Dijon mustard.166  -   W ve got a teaspon of cinnamon.167  -   Got a teaspoon of cumin.168  -   Got a teaspoon of chilli powder.169  -   So again, very similar tothe marinade.170  -   Teaspoon of smoked paprika.171  -   And then  ve got a teaspoonof mustard powder.172  -   Tha s English mustard powder.And a couple of bayleaves.173  -   And then I want a goodpinch of salt.174  -   About a teaspoon,teaspoon and a half.175  -   Next up, w re gonna putthe peel, or the zest from the orange.176  -   And this will caramelizeand break down,177  -   so tha s why  m putting it inin long strips,178  -   cause tha s gonna caramelizeas it cooks.179  -   What  m doing is just bringingthat mixture up to the boil,180  -   so when the ribs are cooked,the ve got that nice caramelization,181  -   the re gonna goin the resting tray,182  -   and then that hot marinade goesover the top.183  -   Putting in a jalapeno,seeds and all,184  -   tha s gonna add a bit of kickto the sauce.185  -   Just to infuse all thoseflavors,186  -   and what  m getting isthat sweet-sour187  -   and then a bit of thatchilli heat kicking through,188  -   so le s have a look atthese ribs.189  -   This is what  m after,  m afterthis nice charriness here.190  -   The re not far off.191  -   Right, nice non-stick heavy-dutyroasting pan. Important.192  -   And then in go the ribs.193  -   And the reason i s important,is that194  -   if you got a flimsybaking tray,195  -   it does t conduct the heat that well, youwant something like this, if you buy that,196  -   even though i s gonna be much moreexpensive than a flimsy roasting tray,197  -   i s gonna last you a lifetime,especially at home.198  -   I s important that you get a niceeven distribution of heat199  -   all through that dish.200  -   So, ribs have been grilled and le sput the sauce on.201  -   And then all w ve got to do ispour this lovely sweet and sour sauce202  -   over the top ofthe ribs.203  -   Look at all that. That looksabsolutely...204  -   Jeez, cleans your nose as well.Beautiful.205  -   So all tha s gonna happen is thisjust goes in for a206  -   bit of a slow braise for aboutan hour and a half207  -   until the re nice and soft.208  -   And how do you knowthe re nice and soft?209  -   Basically, you should be able topush the spoon through the flesh,210  -   or through the pork meatbetween the bones.211  -   And if you can push it through,then i s cooked.212  -   Cause it tells you that when youeat it, i s gonna be nice and tender.213  -   Right, now.214  -   These are gonna go into the ovenat about 195 degrees for an hour and a half.215  -   And the whole idea is that youturn those as the liquor starts to reduce216  -   and starts to caramelize,217  -   maybe three or four times duringthat hour and a half.218  -   And hopefully, at the end yo re gonnahave just enough sauce219  -   just to coat those ribs, to makethem nice and shiny, and sticky.220  -   Tha s all you need.221  -   After the break.222  -   Gary plates up hissticky ribs.223  -   Ok, so who wants to taste?224  -   And the all-American feastcontinues225  -   with Georg s classic Waldorf saladand easy mayonnaise.226  -   Wow, that looks great,George.227  -   W ve got the ribsnow in the oven228  -   and they need to cook for aboutan hour and a half229  -   so that the re nice and tender.230  -   In the meantime, George,what are you gonna make?231  -    m gonna make a simpleWaldorf salad,232  -   an inspiration from the Waldorfhotel in New York City.233  -   Wha s the essence of a good Waldorf?234  -   I think fresh apple,fresh celery,235  -   you know, walnuts,toasted walnuts,236  -   but a really deliciousand yummy mayonnaise.237  -   And tha s my job.238  -   Tha s your job cause youmake a great mayonnaise.239  -    ve been waiting to show youhow to make a simple mayonnaise.240  -   Why, because i s so easy. Do thave to buy it,241  -   and a few of you had problems.I s the whole emulsion,242  -   or the whole idea of the emulsionthat yo re having problems with.243  -   And the emulsion in a fresh egg mayonnaiseis the egg and the oil.244  -   And once you understandhow that all comes together,245  -   yo ll have confidence.246  -   Now somebody that did tdo too well was Alvin247  -   with your coleslaw.248  -   It is the first time h s mademayonnaise, you can tell,249  -   and tha s not the best coleslaw, ll be honest.250  -   So with that in mind, Alvin,come up,251  -   and yo re gonna help mewith the mayonnaise.252  -   Okay, Alvin, this is amazinglysimple, yo re gonna laugh.253  -   First of all, nice little blenderlike this, this little canister blender.254  -   I s very fast, instead ofhaving to use a whisk,255  -   which you can, you can cheatand use this baby.256  -   One tablespoon full of mustard,nice and heaped.257  -   Yep, good.258  -   Mustard is an emulsifier. So tha s gonnahelp emulsify the egg and the oil.259  -   Two whole eggs.260  -   Ah. Whole eggs, not justegg yolks.261  -   Lot of recipes require justegg yolks,262  -   tha s classic, but the egg whitehelps it bond and bind as well,263  -   and ther s nothing worse than havingrecipes with egg yolks only,264  -   cause what do you do withegg whites, right?265  -   Two tablespoons full ofsweet vinegar,266  -   in this case a white balsamic.267  -   And I like that little bit of sweetness,because a lot of bought mayonnaises268  -   got added sugar, peopleget used to that flavor,269  -   but i s actually quitenice.270  -   Cause i s the whole acidity and sweetnessthing at play again.271  -   Pinch of salt.272  -   Now because a blenderis so fast,273  -   unlike whisking by handwhich is slow,274  -   you can put a large amount of oilin to start off with275  -   cause the blades spin, bang, hundredsof times within the first few seconds.276  -    m gonna put a good measureof oil first.277  -   Click the lid on,start it off.278  -   And just give it ten seconds.279  -   Ten seconds, on.280  -   Can you see it coming together?281  -   Turn it off.282  -   You can see this is not split,even though i s thin,283  -   see how i s all emulsifiedtogether,284  -   so you can use that as goodindicator to put another285  -   quart of the oil in,turn it on.286  -   See how it smooths out there?Turn it off.287  -   Another third of the oil.288  -   Turn it on.289  -   And give it anotherthirty seconds.290  -   Same thing will happen.291  -   Now, see it?292  -   Tha s it.293  -   And again, you can havea look at it.294  -   See? I s nice and smooth.295  -   Add half of that.296  -   Turn on again.297  -   Looking beautiful.298  -   Okay, done.299  -   Now we want this really thick,alright?300  -   See wha s happening?301  -   I s so thick now that the machin shaving trouble just mixing it around.302  -   So remember that if yourmayonnaise looks particularly oily,303  -   you can add a little splash of wateror vinegar or lemon juice,304  -   just to sort of bring it together,because i s the water,305  -   that will also then act as sort ofa medium to allow it to emulsify.306  -   It becomes too oily,it will split.307  -   Turn it back on.308  -   Okay, done.309  -   Wow.310  -   Does that look a littlebit different to your mayonnaise?311  -   Just do t need eat the whole lot.But just try that.312  -   Tip your finger in it. And obviouslyyou can season that the way you want.313  -   Creamy.314  -   Really good.315  -   I s a great mayonnaise.316  -   I s just very simple. You can addwhatever flavor you want into it,317  -   but remember, use a little canisterblender like that, makes it very very easy.318  -    m not even gonna botherputting it into a container.319  -    m done,  ll see you in a minutewith your Waldorf salad.320  -   - Ciao.- Cheers, mate.321  -   Right, so Waldorf salad.322  -   The essence of the Waldorf saladis the acidity and sweetness of that apple,323  -   and the mayonnaise.324  -   So w re gonna really accentuatethose elements.325  -   The apple, I wanna put a couplelittle textures on there,326  -   so  m gonna make a simpleapple jelly,327  -   and as well as that,fresh apple on the plate.328  -   So to make the apple jelly, Adam,come up, join me,329  -   le s make it together, mate.330  -   I think for me when I make anytype of fruit jelly,331  -   i s all about the fruit.332  -   If i s apple, all I wanna putinto it is apple.333  -   I do t wanna start fussing it around toomuch with adding other elements,334  -   other flavors.335  -   Using the juicer you can leech outall those beautiful flavors.336  -   So the first step is to makeapple juice.337  -    m using green apples because I thinkthe ve got a real lovely tartness to them.338  -   As well as sweetness, ther s thissort of bitterness and sharpness about them,339  -   that I really love.340  -   W re just gonna quickly removethat pith, and the pips.341  -   The pips are bitter, and they are tgonna add beautiful flavor to it.342  -   You ever made a jelly before,Adam?343  -   I have actually,on the weekend.344  -   - What did you make?- Maple syrup jelly.345  -   Yum, delicious.346  -   Okay, next step, squeeze a lemon, so itdoes t oxidize or go brown, the apple.347  -   Next step, juicer.348  -   Pop all your apples in, and thenput the lid on and then turn it on.349  -   Sure.350  -   Joanne, you got a question?351  -   If you do t have a juicer, can youuse like a good organic juice? Apple juice?352  -   Nothing saying you ca t.I just love freshly squeezed juice.353  -   I think ther s just nothing better.- Yeah.354  -   Beautiful. Fantastic.355  -   So we set that aside. Next stepis to soak our gelatin.356  -   For 500 mils of apple juice,w ve got four sheets of gelatin.357  -   We need to soak the gelatin.358  -   Look, I prefer to use gold leaf gelatin,i s a refined product.359  -   I s top notch, i s the A grade stuff.360  -   You can use powdered gelatin,if you prefer.361  -   Adam, thank you, mate.- Thanks, George.362  -   Right guys, our gelatin has beensoaking in water.363  -   And w re just gonna pop thatinto a pan,364  -   and then with a little bit of the juicew re just gonna temper the gelatin.365  -   And I only do that with a little bitof the juice,366  -   I do t do it with all of it. I do twanna boil this, okay?367  -   The flavor is complete for me. If Iboil it,  m gonna affect its flavor.368  -   And generally what you do, when youboil something or cook something369  -   so delicate like that, you sendall that flavor into the air.370  -   I want it in there. I do twanna lose that.371  -    m just gonna parse this liquid now,as you can see i s starting to separate.372  -   So w ve got froth on the top,and all the juice on the bottom.373  -   So as you can see, our gelatinis melting in with that little bit of juice374  -   of the apple that we added in there.375  -   Now  m gonna add thismelted gelatin into my apple mixture,376  -   and just stir that through.377  -   Then this goes into a tray.378  -   This will take about an hourto two hours to set in a fridge.379  -   Because we have t gotmuch time380  -    m going to pop that jelly intothe blast freezer381  -   and chill it down as quicklyas possible.382  -   Right guys, the next step.383  -   Gary made this beautiful mayonnaise,and what  m gonna add to it384  -   is some onion, sweet and sour.385  -   This is ultra, ultra simple,okay?386  -   One onion, finely diced.387  -   You do t need oil.388  -   Sugar. One,389  -   two,390  -   and a half tablespoonsof sugar.391  -   In keeping with the theme of the Waldorfsalad,  m using a cider vinegar,392  -   probably about half a cup.393  -   Gas, a nice sort ofmedium heat.394  -   Now this is what our onionswill look like after 20 minutes.395  -   Ther s no color, the re justnice and translucent,396  -   and sort of goldenish.397  -   As you can see, ther s not muchliquid left at all.398  -   I s all dissolved pretty much.399  -   So  m gonna add a couple of spoonsof this delicious mayonnaise Gary made.400  -   One,401  -   two,402  -   and that forms the dressingto our Waldorf salad.403  -   Onion mayonnaise,sweet and sour.404  -   Right, I want to put some freshgreen apple on there.405  -   And I just wanna do nice,thin slices,406  -   that  m going to presenton the plate.407  -   And just a little bit of lemon juiceover the top,408  -   so it does t oxidize or go brown,the apple.409  -   Right,  m gonna toast some walnutsand I think, again,410  -   the walnuts are a crucial elementto the Waldorf salad.411  -   So we throw a few of thesewalnuts into a pan.412  -   And  m just gonna sugar them lightly413  -   and just sort of dry roastthem in the pan. Okay?414  -   A little pinch of salt,tha s as simple as that.415  -   Right, le s plate up.416  -   So, first of all, our sweet and souronion mayonnaise.417  -   So blob,418  -   blob,419  -   and then some apples.420  -   Few up like that.421  -   Few up like that.422  -   Then some of our little babycos leaves, just gorgeous,423  -   I wanna show these off.424  -   Some celery.425  -   Just gonna stand these up, and again,show them off, cause the re just beautiful.426  -   Then some walnuts.427  -   Next up is these beautifulnasturtium leaves.428  -   You can buy these from anygood nursery, these nasturtium leaves.429  -   Next, some of these frisee,w re just gonna scatter that around.430  -   I s starting to lookreally beautiful.431  -   Great, jelly set.432  -   And  m simply just gonna scoopsome nodules out of jelly433  -   and just pop that on the plate.434  -   Without any fuss, does t needto be cubes or squares.435  -   And then finally, a bit of the old fella,my mate olive oil,436  -   and some of Gar s mate,salt.437  -   Right guys, so her s my interpretationof a Waldorf salad.438  -   Wow, that looks great,George.439  -   Now for the ribs.What a contrast.440  -   Beer ribs and your beautifulsalad.

This is my restaurantFlying Fish. Welcome.512  -    m co-owner andhead chef here,513  -   as well as being part ofFlying Fish Fiji514  -   at the Sheraton Andy.515  -    ve been in the industryabout 31 years.516  -   The thing that defines Flying Fishis our little twist on Sri Lankan flavors.517  -   The cooking style could easily bedescribed as518  -   seafood cooked simply,served elegantly,519  -   in a beautiful surrounding.520  -   You guys have done a mystery boxa few days ago521  -   and the main ingredient wasmud crab, I heard.522  -   Yes.523  -   Some of you got right into it.Some of you had to play and524  -   other people did t eventouch it.525  -   Crustaceans are just amazing thingsand George and Gary have asked me to526  -   come and tell you a little bitabout them and hopefully get you527  -   over those barriers andhopefully I can give you528  -   a bit of an edge onthe rest of them as well.529  -   What  m gonna do today530  -   is show you two really simple,tasty dishes531  -   using a West Australian marron.532  -   But first,  m gonna take you throughthe world of crustaceans.533  -    m gonna start with prawns. Prawnsare available in hundreds of species.534  -   You can buy them on the markets green,which is uncooked, or cooked.535  -   Fresh prawns do t really lastbecause a prawn has an enzyme in it536  -   which actually keeps growingwhen the prawn dies.537  -   The head goes black and the headwill start to droop.538  -   So a frozen prawn is better.539  -   Yo re better off taking it home,defrosting it under clean running water.540  -   First, school prawns, you canbuy them green or cooked,541  -   then, lightly floured,pan fried or deep fried542  -   with a bit of aioli, lemon juice,really, tha s all you need.543  -   You can eat it all as well.544  -   The cooked ones are greatfor barbecues,545  -   just give them to your guestswith a finger bowl and a cloth.546  -   The king of all prawns for Australiais the Eastern King.547  -   I s got beautiful flesh, i swonderfully flavored,548  -   and when you cook it, it staysnice and firm.549  -   Take you next into the world of crabs,now crabs,  ll be back in a minute.550  -   This guy nearly got me.551  -   Tha s a Queensland mud crab.552  -   When you feel for a crab,when you pick up a crab,553  -   fingers underneathand hold it like that554  -   and hope to hell that i s tight,because that yo ll lose your finger,555  -   that will take your finger off no problem,or crush it very badly.556  -   You hold them quite tight, and if youroll them over you can feel the weight.557  -   Ther s another train of thoughtwhere if you squeeze this back flipper,558  -   should be nice and firm as well.559  -   Look at this guy.560  -   This is actually just knownas a giant crab.561  -   They grow to another seven to eightkilos with claws the size of my arm.562  -   And the way to eat these is enjoy itin a restaurant with about ten friends.563  -   It costs you a lot less,and what will happen564  -   is that the ll bring it out to youin about ten courses.565  -   So yo ll start with the soup,then fried with noodles, then the claws,566  -   i s just a wonderful way to eat.567  -   Crustaceans is all about familyand friends568  -   and being with a group of people.569  -   All right, next cra sthe beautiful blue swimmer.570  -   Cooked and green or blue. One of theonly crustaceans that do t come live.571  -   They do t survive very wellout of the water.572  -   Good in Thai curries. One of the bestcurries  ve ever had573  -   was the Thai yellow curry sittingon a beach in Thailand with a beer.574  -   You could steam them,take the meat out,575  -   but if yo re gonna do that,buy these cooked, guys.576  -   All right, her s an exciting577  -   development in the worldof Australian aquaculture.578  -   Soft-shell crabs are amazingbecause you can eat the whole shell.579  -   These guys are great to cookin handrolls like the Japanese do.580  -   The Americans crumb them.581  -   I just prefer battered, like a bitof tempura batter. Deep fried.582  -   Again, really crisp and nice,583  -   and the sensation of eating a wholecrab, shell and all but also584  -   beautiful flavors and sweet,lovely flesh.585  -   OK, I have a live southern rocklobster and a live local lobster.586  -   You can tell the re very different.587  -   The local lobster comes from the southcoast of New South Wales, around Ulladulla.588  -   Southern rock lobster is foundall the way around the coastline,589  -   probably from Queensland all the waydown to Western Australia.590  -   Varieties change, the species change, butthe southern rock lobster is the prized one.591  -   I s prized for the flavor of its flesh,i s prized for its size, and also592  -   for the way that the flesh cooks.593  -   I s beautiful and soft and italso makes wonderful sashimi.594  -   On the freshwater side, ther s a fewothers that  d like to show you.595  -   Ther s a marron, which is whatwe are using today.596  -   And this is, as I said, fromWestern Australia,597  -   and really one of the trueindigenous species of Australia.598  -   And a yabby.599  -   The thing about freshwater fish thoughis the re probably a little bit600  -   short on the flavor.601  -   They have a nice sweetness,602  -   but you really need to think when yo recooking with freshwater crayfish603  -   about what yo ll combineto enhance the flavor.604  -   And I think i s up to youwhich way you want to go.605  -   I feel that tha s the king, and i sreally one of the most beautiful creatures.606  -   And the color of the shell, once i scooked, i s stunning.607  -   These guys in salads are beautiful, as longas yo re really careful with how,608  -   what you put it in withand how you cook it.609  -   All right, finally, bugs.610  -   Now, most people do t like to eat bugs,but bugs ar ethese wonderful creatures.611  -   Ther s about five varieties.612  -   The one with the wide, round headis a balmain bug.613  -   The thing about a balmain bugis it has a very,614  -   very distinctive flavor.615  -   Some people dislike it immensely,others love it.616  -   So if you do t like the strength of theflavor, then you go for a Moreton Bay bug.617  -   But as a cooked product,this is great.618  -   Live, chill them down, and thenuse them in salads or stir fries.619  -   I have to tell you one more thing.All of this stuff, the re all animals.620  -   The re all creatures, and a lot of themare best live.621  -   So you need to dispatchwith these creatures humanely.622  -   I s a big part of it, you know.623  -   The most humane way to do itis to chill them.624  -   So that means, put them in the bagthat you get them from,625  -   into the freezer. Do t let them freezebecause it will break down the flesh.626  -   But it needs to get to the stage, wherethey are actually just very slow.627  -   Once the ve come out of the freezer,they are virtually incapacitated628  -   and they wo t be feeling pain.So do it very quickly.629  -   Cut them directly in half.630  -   The other way to do is buy themat the markets and the ll kill it for you.631  -   If you bring a big pot of water to boiland you put a crustacean into it,632  -   it does t matter what size it is,and you cook it for eight to nine minutes,633  -   yo ll find that i s always perfect.634  -   When we return.635  -   Quite easy just to crack them with yourfingers and then break them open.636  -   Peter reveals the simplicityof his showstopping marron salad.637  -   All about sensation, tha swhat food is all about.638  -   This dish is a salad of marron,shaved fennel,639  -   avruga and Asian dressing.640  -   I s really simple, i s light,and i s all about flavors.641  -   First off, starting with the sauce,ther s a few classic techniques.642  -   Firstly, julienne.643  -   You just slice the chilliall the way down the middle644  -   and then you need to flatten it up,take the seeds out first,645  -   but then to get really, reallynice julienne,646  -   you actually need to takea lot of the flesh away,647  -   because what you wanna do is justhave the skin.648  -   So by placing a knife downlike that,649  -   having your fingers nice and flatin case you slip,650  -   and just shaving a perfectlittle piece off the chilli.651  -   And then let your knifejust slide over.652  -   So, tha s a julienne, going toput that into here.653  -   Next will be a chiffonade.I s like a julienne but654  -   you usually use itfor leaves.655  -   You want a really fine garnish if yo remaking a soup or something like that,656  -   and you want to put some leavesthrough it,657  -   to chiffonade them isa great way to do it.658  -   So take all the stems off,659  -   and w re doing it with justone stalk of coriander.660  -    m also going to use for flavorthe root of the coriander.661  -   So  m just gonna take onecoriander root.662  -   We want to extract all the flavor,just bang it and then chop it.663  -   People throw the very endof the root away but664  -   if you know Thai cuisine,tha s where the flavor is.665  -   That goes into the plate.666  -   Now, chiffonade. You can putall the leaves together.667  -   Very fine again, i s all about colorand you notice too that668  -    ve got no liquids in therebecause this is a very fresh dressing.669  -   If I put all the liquids in, which arequite strong flavors,670  -   wha s gonna happen is thateverything will wilt,671  -   the colors will go and i s notgonna be as nice to eat.672  -   So next is brunois.Tha s a fine dice, so673  -   to get the finest dice, slice downas close as you possibly can.674  -   Halfway, and then one more time,so yo re doing three cuts into the onion.675  -   And then, just again, a nice dicestraight through.676  -   And  ll throw that in as well.677  -   Next is garlic, crushed garlic.678  -   You crush garlic like this, yo re reallygetting all the essence out of it.679  -   Just remember that yo vedone it on this board680  -   before you have your vegemiteand toast in the morning,681  -   tha s not the best.682  -   All right, so next is spring onion.683  -    m not using the leaves, ve got my green in there684  -   and I do t really need it, what  mafter is the real flavor from this.685  -   And then, doing a rough julienne.686  -   Turning it around, and finelydicing it.687  -   Textur s really important in food,i s how it feels in your mouth,688  -   i s like wine or anything,i s all that sensation,689  -   tha s what foo s all about.690  -   Next we have to have twobeautiful limes.691  -   Just give it a nice roll, okay?692  -   Yo re gonna loosen up all the littlecells in there693  -   and yo ll get more juice out of it,so you get value for money.694  -   Using a microplane, I just wannaget the zest695  -   by using as much of two limesas you can.696  -   Okay, so just juicing them. Juice andzests make two different flavors.697  -   The zest has that really oily, beautifulcitric sort of flavor,698  -   but it does t have the acid, and thenyou add the juice too699  -   and it sort of brings it up and gives youthat beautiful citric acid as well.700  -   A fifty grams of brown sugar,adds a sweetness,701  -   stir this through, i s really importantthat it dissolves,702  -   that you do t have any solidbits of sugar in there.703  -   Brown sugar has more molasses in it,so you get that beautiful caramely flavor.704  -   So the lime and brown sugar,about 30 mils of fish sauce,705  -    m saying about because the concentrationof salt in fish sauce changes.706  -   So you start with that and thenadd more,707  -   i s very hard to take out salt,one of those ones708  -   tha s very very very hardto remove.709  -   Put less than you think,add at the end,710  -   and that way yo re gonna end upwith a much better result.711  -   Five mils of soy sauce, measure this,try and use light soy sauce712  -   cause we do t wanna be addingtoo much salt.713  -   Just make sure all the sugaris dissolved,714  -   add it to your ingredients715  -   and stir.716  -   Now i s time to taste,now i s time to balance.717  -   Try not to double dip when youtaste as well.718  -   Perfect.719  -    m lucky this time.720  -   But try to get it right the first coupleof times, because with strong sauces,721  -   once yo ve tasted it a few times,you ca t taste anything.722  -   But now tha s fresh, i s crunchy,ready to go, so  m gonna put it to side,723  -   the next stage is garnish.724  -   So, grapes.725  -    m using flame grapes,because they have no seeds.726  -   Ther s another little garnishI have, which is just chives.727  -   And then all w re doing is justcutting some batons.728  -   This is a pretty part of it.729  -   Shave fennel, a mandolin or a verysharp knife.730  -   Three more ingredients.731  -   First one, and I have to use it,flying fish roe.732  -   We are at Flying Fish. But the reasonI love to use this,733  -   Japanese use it and most peopleuse it for the same reason,734  -   and that is a crunch, a greattexture and a beautiful flavor as well.735  -    m also gonna use avruga.736  -   Now avruga has an amazinglysmoky flavor.737  -   But i s actually not caviar.It looks like it, but i s fish,738  -   which has been ground up and thenmade to look like fish eggs,739  -   and flavored with a littlebit of smoke.740  -   And lastly, sumac. Anyone knowwhat sumac is?741  -   Kind of some... Middle-Easterncultures use it a lot.742  -   Yeah, it gives anothersensation.743  -   The last thing we have to do now,is clean the cooked marrons.744  -   Very simple. Push the shell in,and twist it.745  -   And then you get all of it.746  -   Let me do one of the claws, so youbreak them off at the first knuckle.747  -   Next, removing the shell. I s quiteeasy, just crack them with your fingers,748  -   and then break them open.749  -   And what yo re trying to dois to get the piece of meat out750  -   intact, looking lovely.Okay?751  -   Next stage, using the heel of your knife,just crack it lightly,752  -   and peel that off, so that you havea whole claw intact,753  -   and that really is just a garnish.754  -   Next, just cutting it downthe middle,755  -   and here yo ll see theintestinal tract.756  -   Just take it out, and squarethem off757  -   so that i s gonna looklovely.758  -   For each one of these dishesI am just using five pieces.759  -   Now, to plate it.760  -   The fennel with the sauce,two spoonfuls of that into it.761  -   W ll get a nice mix.762  -   One bowl is enough for four serves.763  -   Little bit of fennel in the bottom.764  -   And now  m just gonna buildit with marron.765  -   The next, the sauce.766  -   Just another little spoonfulon top.767  -   Next is the avruga, one nice spoonfulwill allow the smokiness of this come out.768  -   Just on top.769  -   Followed by three pieces of grape.Just for visual effect.770  -   Next, sumac.771  -   And next, flying fish roe. A greatsensation as far as textur s concerned.772  -   Nice flavors as well. The next isthe claws, just surround the outside.773  -   Something else for people to bite.774  -   And then a garnish of chive.775  -   So tha s it guys, salad of marron,shaved fennel, and avruga. Asian dressing.776  -   Come up and taste.777  -   So visually, lots of colors,there should be lots of flavors there too,778  -   and I suggest you get a little bit ofeverything on your spork an have a try,779  -   so please.780  -    m someone that does t likereally strong flavored seafood,781  -   but I love the marron, becauseit is quite subtle,782  -   and then it really complementsputting the grapes with it783  -   is a really lovely complement, becausei s a little bit sweet too.784  -   Oh, thank you.785  -   So ther s three tips that I thinkyou should always use786  -   when you make a dish like this.787  -   Firstly, fresh seafood. Make friendswith your fishmonger.788  -   The most vital thing, you ca t takesalt out. So just make sure789  -   that you add a little bit lessand then finish it off by tasting it.790  -   And the last of course, keep it simple.Look after your flavors,791  -   and people always enjoy your food.792  -   Up next,Gary goes Italian793  -   with a flavor packed renditionof veal saltimbocca.794  -   What you wanna do is cook that vealso i s still pink in the middle.795  -   And a little later.796  -   Tha s looking beautiful, look howshiny tha s looking.797  -   George presents an elegant dessert treat.White mousse canelloni.798  -   I love it.  m goingto make that.799  -   Next up in MasterClass, w re goingto do an Italian classic using veal,800  -   which is veal saltimbocca.801  -   What veal saltimbocca isis veal802  -   wrapped in pancetta orprosciutto with sage.803  -   So I need a helper for this one.804  -   Callum, can you come upand give me a hand?805  -   Sure.806  -   This is a pretty expensivepiece of veal.807  -   First up w re just gonna take offthe scotch essentially from the rib.808  -   What I wanna do is cut littlesteaks from this, little scallops,809  -   that are about 120 gramsor so,810  -   which w re gonna batout lightly.811  -   All right, Callum? If you can stretch outa bit of that clean film,812  -   and then just pop those rightin the middle and equidistant apart813  -   and then put another layerover the top,814  -   and  ll show youthe first one.815  -   When you bat something out,yo re not whacking it randomly,816  -   just trying very lightly,work in nice neat lines,817  -   I need to work across and then up,or up and then across,818  -   but work in a methodical fashion.Be very gentle.819  -   Hold the hammer close to the headof the hammer,820  -   so that yo re not putting inenormous amount of weight on,821  -   and then yo ve got some control.822  -   Just very gentle, yeah?823  -   Yeah, perfect.Brilliant.824  -   Le s do the next phase, and tha s wrappingthese little babies up with the sage.825  -   Yo re just gonna put theseslices down.826  -   This is the pancetta.827  -   And then what w re gonna do is puttwo nice leaves of sage on each of the veal.828  -   Face up like that.829  -   Just press them downonto the meat.830  -   And what that sage is going to dois put flavor into that veal.831  -   And then kind of what you want to dois just put these832  -   upside down and then wrap themquite tightly and so that the ve stuck833  -   and you get that little piece ofveal like that. Alright?834  -   The term saltimbocca meansleap in your mouth or jump in your mouth835  -   which is really interesting because we sayveal saltimbocca and it sounds beautiful836  -   whereas if we put veal jump inyour mouth on the menu,837  -   noone would buy it. Alright.Thanks for that.838  -   You can go and havea little seat.839  -   Next stage in the saltimbocca,you do t have to do this,840  -   but i s a little dusting of flour.So  m gonna put some pepper and salt.841  -   onto the flour just to season it,and then what I wanna do842  -   is just very lightly dip that in,843  -   and all this will do is it will giveyou a lovely golden brown finish844  -   on the saltimbocca. And also, m gonna deglaze the pan845  -   and make a little sauce in it, and it willleave a little flour residue in the pan,846  -   which will thicken that sauce.847  -   Good amount of olive oil, cause you wantit to brown really evenly.848  -   At this quite a high heat, becausewhat you wanna do is cook that veal849  -   so i s still pink in the middle.You see that golden brown?850  -   Tha s what  m after,which is beautiful.851  -   So because tha s only gonna takea few seconds,852  -    m gonna pop in garlic, whichis gonna crisp up,853  -   and  ve got some capers, that werein salt but are now rinsed.854  -   Sage leaves, plenty of them, and thena nice little chunk of butter,855  -   and  m just gonna allow it tofroth up around the veal.856  -   And once all tha s in and starting topermeate around the veal,857  -   i s only now that  m gonnaturn it over,858  -   because I know that all that flavo sworked its way around most of the surface859  -   of that presentation side.860  -   And then next in  m gonna throw insome cherry tomatoes,861  -   and this is gonna form a partof my sauce.862  -   All right, so veal out. And tha sstill pretty pink.863  -   Just gonna let that rest.864  -   And then what I want to do is justcook those tomatoes for a few seconds,865  -   and  m gonna actually just tryand crush a couple866  -   so that they bleed intothat butter.867  -   Then wine.868  -   And this is what I mean aboutbuilding the sauce in the pan869  -   and using that little bit ofthe flour off the veal,870  -   just to give you some whitein the sauce.871  -   And then tiny little bitof lemon juice.872  -   And then  ve got some littlebaby spinach leaves which873  -   are just gonna add a lovely color.And just toss it for a few seconds.874  -   And you can add a little bitof pepper, if you want.875  -   But essentially what  ve got is this lovelysauce made from the juices of the pan,876  -   the garlic tha s gonecrispy and golden,877  -   and then those crushed tomatoes.878  -   The vea s rested, sauce is made,smelling gorgeous,879  -   so what w re gonna do nowis plate it up.880  -   So all I do is just pop thison the plate.881  -   And then a few of these littleblistered cherry tomatoes.882  -   W ll put a lemon.883  -   And then just a drizzle of Georg sold mate, the olive oil.884  -   Alright?885  -   And tha s my interpretation of classicveal saltimbocca886  -   and a little sauce made from cherry tomatoesand garlic and from the juices in the pan.887  -   Okay, we need some tasters.888  -   Claire, Jake and Callum.889  -   Dig in. Tell me what you think.890  -   Sage is awesome.891  -   I love that crispiness,the good juiciness of the tomatoes,892  -   i s really good.- Gives a little freshness to it.893  -   The sage is milder than I wasexpecting it to be.894  -   I love it, i s really good.895  -   Beautiful. Thanks, guys.896  -   So my three tips fora perfect saltimbocca.897  -   Choice of veal is absolutelycritical.898  -   If i s pre-tenderized it will be dry,especially if you overcook it.899  -   Tip number two, remember, veal does thave a lot of fat, cause i s young,900  -   so you have to cook it quicklyand keep it pink,901  -   otherwise it will be overcookedand very very dry.902  -   And tip number three, always thinkabout those juices in the pan903  -   and how easy it is to makea nice sauce out of that sediment.904  -   I s gonna make the world of differenceto your dish.905  -   When we come back, Peter Kuruvitadelves deeper into his seafood basket.906  -   And then just build it up slowly so thatyou get a really nice pile of marrons907  -   with this lovely sauce.908  -   W re at Flying Fishand w re doing crustaceans.909  -   The dish that  m doing nextis gonna be marron steamed with910  -   ginger chilli shallot sauce, which isa favorite in the restaurant,911  -   and has been on my menusfor probably twenty years.912  -   So welcome to somesecrets.913  -   Steamed marrons with gingerchilli shallot sauce914  -   This is a really easy sauce.Three chillies,915  -   chop the tops off, leave the seeds in,we want the heat, roughly chop.916  -   Next is garlic. Three clovesof garlic for this sauce.917  -   Again, roughly chopped.918  -   Three knobs of ginger. A knob of gingershould be about the size of your thumb.919  -   So roughly chop as well.920  -   Coriander, including roots, washed,make sure ther s nothing in there.921  -   And just chop it, leaves and all,so that yo re gonna have922  -   texture as well as the color.923  -   Spring onion.924  -   Just one of these, and this willgive you that oniony flavor,925  -   a little bit of the sweetnessas well.926  -   300 mils of soy sauce. Lightsoy sauce.927  -   300 mils of mirin. Mirin isa sweet sake,928  -   so that will add a little bitof viscosity to the dish929  -   and also when it cooks down, it willassist in the caramelization930  -   and the sweetness of it.931  -   250 mils of sweet chilli sauce.932  -   White wine to give it acid,and to break it down a little bit.933  -   Tha s 125 mils of white wine.934  -   And sesame oil.A 100 mils of that.935  -   Okay. Next stage isvery easy.936  -   Put the lid on, pulse ita few times,937  -   and once it gets going...938  -   Blend it up really well,it does t take long.939  -   And tha s it. Ther syour sauce.940  -   I s easy to make andvery tasty.941  -   - Pete?- Yeah?942  -   If yo re gonna make that sauce in advance,how long can you keep that for?943  -   Because of all the ingredientsthat I put in,944  -   i ll hold for three to sixweeks.945  -   So make up a batch. Just to makea small amount is quite hard.946  -   And  ve given this to peopleand they just use it on everything.947  -   You can use it in chicken, you canput it on prawns, or anything.948  -   It goes really wellwith pretty much anything.949  -   Alright, so.A taste.950  -   The only thing you can changeif you want to is the heat.951  -   But using the long red chillies,i s just right.952  -   Next is the marron itself.953  -   Now, the re beinghumanely killed954  -   by putting them intoice water until they go955  -   totally dead and then we cutthem in half.956  -   Sometimes you have to rememberthat they will move,957  -   there will be a twitching there,but they are dead.958  -   - Can you come and help me, my friend?- Sure. Absolutely.959  -    ll show you one, Peter, and thenyou can get into the rest of them.960  -   Now put it through the headand crunch down,961  -   and turn it around,and the same thing.962  -   When you get to the tail part,if yo re too slow,963  -   what will happen isyo ll crush it.964  -   So hand there,all the way through.965  -   Now, inside here arethe guts,966  -   and also you need to get outthe intestinal tract.967  -   And I want them put face upbecause I do t want968  -   the sauce to boil through them.969  -   What I want is the sauce to bein the bottom,970  -   and the marron is just nicelysteamed. Wanna have a go?971  -   Okay, yeah. So be strong, becausewhen you back off972  -   when yo re a bit concerned,tha s when yo re gonna slip.973  -   Hold it firmly, push into it.Tha s it, all the way down, nice and fast.974  -   Now turn the marron around.- You flip the tail around yeah?975  -   Yes, have it nice and flat,otherwise yo re gonna crush the shell.976  -   Tha s it.977  -   Great.978  -   - That tract is going out...- It will come out.979  -   With your crustaceans oreven fish, do t wash them.980  -   You see people opening oystersand then wash the oyster.981  -   Yo ve lost the beautyof the oyster, you know?982  -   Oyster comes from South Coastsomewhere, you want to taste that river.983  -   So Peter, for instance,is that okay?984  -   Tha s fine.I s pretty simple, is t it?985  -   I s all about flavorsand freshness.986  -   The meat in this marronis nice and firm,987  -   and tha s the thing about havinglive crustaceans.988  -   I s that a lot of them do nottransport very well once the re dead.989  -   So i s kind of necessary to enjoythe best that a crustacean has.990  -   Thank you, sir. The restof it is easy.991  -   So lastly,  m going to putthe sauce in, but992  -   the sauce, as you can see,has started to separate.993  -   So this sauce, even if you keep itfor a long time,994  -   make sure you stir it beforeyou use it every time.995  -   Then w re just gonna pourabout half of this sauce on,996  -   and then we cook it.997  -   So a lid, some heat.998  -   With these, ten minutesmaximum.999  -   Hot stove, bring itto the boil,1000  -   when i s halfway through,just take it off and check.1001  -   And never let the saucereduce too much.1002  -   You let the sauce reduce too much,it will caramelize and burn.1003  -   You wo t have that lovelygolden color.1004  -   And nothing worse thanburnt food.1005  -   All right, guys, ten minuteshas gone.1006  -   Le s see what the re like.1007  -   The ve turned color, got thatlovely orange glow to them.1008  -   And the aroma that comesoff is great.1009  -   So le s serve it up.What you wanna do here1010  -   is build the height. So get yourselfa really nice base first,1011  -   and then just build it up slowlyso that yo ve got a really nice pile1012  -   of marrons with thislovely sauce.1013  -   Make them cometo a nice pinnacle.1014  -   And then sauce.1015  -   Try and have the sauce just run downin a nice pool of sauce at the bottom.1016  -   And the last stage, of course,is to garnish it.1017  -   Got lots of red there, so  m justgonna put a little bit of coriander into it1018  -   right at the end.1019  -   Tha s it.1020  -   Marrons, ginger chilli shallot saucefrom Flying Fish.1021  -   Come and taste it.1022  -   Let me serve you.1023  -   Yeah, goes well.1024  -   That is such a beautiful texture.1025  -   I s just the right amountof chilli as well.1026  -   Got to remember, too, with marrons,the re not that flavorsome.1027  -   They have a very subtle flavor,so this sort of enhances it.1028  -   I s a great carrier of flavors,but it does t overpower,1029  -   and i s just a great wayto eat crustaceans.1030  -   Glad you enjoy it.- I s delicious.1031  -   Couple of tips. Number one,1032  -   ensure that when you cut them in half,you take out the intestinal tract1033  -   and clean the gut.1034  -   When yo re cooking them,do t turn them at all1035  -   and ensure that they just steam so thatyou can still taste the marron itself.1036  -   And lastly, presentation.Make it stand nice and high,1037  -   give them a finger bowl,make people feel okay1038  -   to eat with their fingers.1039  -   Good luck in the rest of the competition.- Thank you.1040  -   I hope this helps you.

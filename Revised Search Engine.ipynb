I do t believe that.25  -   She does t wanna talk to me.26  -   We never do that in my family.We talk constantly.27  -   I do believe that.28  -   What happened?29  -   I just told her everythingwe knew about the Hawthorne Club.30  -   And I may havesaid some things I should t have.31  -   That sounds bad.  m sorry.32  -   And i s even worse with Amber.33  -   I told her we know sh s behind the theft,along with Liam and McCormack.34  -   Actually, I do t thinkProfessor McCormack35  -   had anything to do with forgingor stealing the Eloquent Peasant.36  -   What? It... Tell me everything.37  -   Poor Wilbur. He has no ideah s in the butche s truck.38  -   What are we supposed to do now, Oliver?39  -   Wh s Oliver?

Our friend is in trouble.52  -   <  m telling you / 53  -   McCormack said the papyrus wasjust as old as the Eloquent Peasant,54  -   and when he found out it was missing,55  -   he freaked out and saidhe needed to go talk to the board.56  -   About what?57  -   He probably thinks that missing pieceof papyrus was used for the forgery.58  -   And from the look on his face,59  -    m pretty surehe did t have anything to do with it.60  -   But......if McCormack did t do it,61  -   then that just leaves Amber and Liam.62  -   - Could they do this by themselves?- I do t know.63  -   McCormack did say whoever forged the EPwould need to be a very talented artist.64  -   An artist, huh?65  -   So, this is my room.66  -   If you get into the club, yo ll be ableto live here when yo re a senior.67  -   No more living with Charli.
